abstract = {The absorptivity at 540 nm of bovine hemiglobincyanide (cyanmethemoglobin) was determined on the basis of the iron content and found to be equal to the established value for human hemiglobincyanide (11.0 L {\textperiodcentered} mmol−1 {\textperiodcentered} cm−1). On this basis the absorption spectra of the common derivatives were determined for bovine hemoglobin. There proved to be only slight differences in the oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, and carboxyhemoglobin spectra between bovine and human hemoglobin. For comparison of the methemoglobin spectra a new series of measurements was made for human hemoglobin. As also found in the rat, the methemoglobin spectrum of bovine blood differed considerably from that in the human. These differences should be taken into account in multicomponent analysis.},
