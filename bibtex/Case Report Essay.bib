abstract = {In this review, we describe the current state of knowledge about the biochemistry of mammalian peroxisomes, especially human peroxisomes. The identification and characterization of yeast mutants defective either in the biogenesis of peroxisomes or in one of its metabolic functions, notably fatty acid beta-oxidation, combined with the recognition of a group of genetic diseases in man, wherein these processes are also defective, have provided hew insights in all aspects of peroxisomes. As a result of these and other studies, the indispensable role of peroxisomes in multiple metabolic pathways has been clarified, and many of the enzymes involved in these pathways have been, characterized, purified, and cloned. One aspect of peroxisomes, which has remained ill defined, is the transport of metabolites across the peroxisomal membrane. Although it is clear that mammalian peroxisomes under in vivo conditions are closed structures, which require the active presence of metabolite transporter proteins, much remains to be learned about the permeability properties of mammalian peroxisomes and the role of the four half ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters therein.

abstract = {X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is due to a defect in a gene that has been mapped to X-q28 and codes for a peroxisomal membrane, the function of which has not yet been defined. Its frequency in males is estimated to be 1:21,000. Primary adrenocortical deficiency and progressive nervous system disability are the main clinical manifestations. Neurological manifestations vary widely and range from a rapidly progressive cerebral form that primarily affects boys to a slowly progressive adult form that involve the spinal cord. Analysis of very long chain fatty acids and mutation analysis permit accurate diagnosis of presymptomatic patients, prenatal diagnosis, and carrier identification. Adrenal steroid replacement therapy effectively corrects the adrenal insufficiency. Bone marrow transplantation stabilizes neurological deficits in the childhood cerebral and adolescent forms and offers the promise of long-term benefit, provided it is performed in the early phase of the disease.},

abstract = {Currently the molecular basis for the clinical heterogeneity of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is poorly understood. The genetic bases for all different phenotypic variants of X-ALD are mutations in the gene encoding the peroxisomal ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, ABCD1 (formerly adrenoleukodystrophy protein, ALDP). ABCD1 transports CoA-activated very long-chain fatty acids from the cytosol into the peroxisome for degradation. The phenotypic variability is remarkable ranging from cerebral inflammatory demyelination of childhood onset, leading to death within a few years, to adults remaining pre-symptomatic through more than five decades. There is no general genotype-phenotype correlation in X-ALD. The default manifestation of mutations in ABCD1 is adrenomyeloneuropathy, a slowly progressive dying-back axonopathy affecting both ascending and descending spinal cord tracts as well as in some cases, a peripheral neuropathy. In about 60{\%} of male X-ALD patients, either in childhood (35-40{\%}) or in adulthood (20{\%}), an initial, clinically silent, myelin destabilization results in conversion to a devastating, rapidly progressive form of cerebral inflammatory demyelination. Here, ABCD1 remains a susceptibility gene, necessary but not sufficient for inflammatory demyelination to occur. Although the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids appears to be essential for the pathomechanism of all phenotypes, the molecular mechanisms underlying these phenotypes are fundamentally different. Cell autonomous processes such as oxidative stress and energy shortage in axons as well as non-cell autonomous processes involving axon-glial interactions seem pertinent to the dying-back axonopathy. Various dynamic mechanisms may underlie the initiation of inflammation, the altered immune reactivity, the propagation of inflammation, as well as the mechanisms leading to the arrest of inflammation after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. An improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in these events is required for the development of urgently needed therapeutics. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

@article{Bachiocco2021,
abstract = {Introduction: X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a metabolic disorder in which very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) are accumulated in the nervous system and adrenal cortex, impairing their functions. Three main variants are described in males: adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), a cerebral form (cALD or cAMN) and Addison's disease only (AD), while for females no classification is used. To evaluate pain and the functional state of afferent fibers, a series of tests was carried out in male and female patients. Methods: Chronic pain occurrence and sensory phenotype profile were assessed in 30 patients (20 male: 10 AMN, 1 cAMN, 1 cALD, 8 AD; and 10 female). A set of instruments assessed the intensity, quality and extent of pain, while a battery of quantitative sensory testing (QST) procedures examined the functional status of A$\beta$ and A$\delta$ fibers. Principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering with sensory responses input were used to identify distinct clusters. Results: Nearly half of the subjects reported pain, with a high prevalence in females and male AMN patients. No sex differences in pain dimensions were found. The sensory responses were heterogeneous, differing among the clinical variants and between genders. Male AMN/cAMN/cALD patients showed the worst impairment. A$\beta$ and A$\delta$ fibers were affected in males and females, but A$\beta$ fibers appeared undamaged in females when tactile sensitivity was tested. Abnormal responses were localized in the lower body district, according to the dying-back pattern of the neuropathy. Cluster analysis showed discrete clusters for each function examined, with well-interpretable sensory and clinical phenotypes. Conclusion: The study of pain and of the sensory profile appears to indicate a difference in the mechanisms underlying the AMN/cAMN/cALD and AD clinical forms and in the treatment of the respective generated pain types.},

abstract = {X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is the most common peroxisomal disorder. The disease is caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene that encodes the peroxisomal membrane protein ALDP which is involved in the transmembrane transport of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA; â‰¥C22). A defect in ALDP results in elevated levels of VLCFA in plasma and tissues. The clinical spectrum in males with X-ALD ranges from isolated adrenocortical insufficiency and slowly progressive myelopathy to devastating cerebral demyelination. The majority of heterozygous females will develop symptoms by the age of 60 years. In individual patients the disease course remains unpredictable. This review focuses on the diagnosis and management of patients with X-ALD and provides a guideline for clinicians that encounter patients with this highly complex disorder. {\textcopyright} 2012 Engelen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Saturated very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs; â‰¥C22:0) accumulate in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD, OMIM 300100), a severe hereditary neurodegenerative disease, due to peroxisomal impairment. Previous studies analysed the development of X-ALD in humans and gene knockout animal models. However, the toxic effect of VLCFA leading to severe symptoms with progressive and multifocal demyelination, adrenal insufficiency and inflammation still remains unclear. To understand the toxic effects of VLCFA in the brain, here we exposed neural cells to VLCFA and analysed the cellular consequences. We found that oligodendrocytes and astrocytes challenged with docosanoic- (C22:0), tetracosanoic- (C24:0) and hexacosanoic acids (C24:0) die within 24 h. VLCFA-induced depolarization of mitochondria in situ and increased intracellular Ca2 level in all three brain cell types provides indications about the mechanism of toxicity of VLCFA. Interestingly, VLCFAs affect to the largest degree the myelin-producing oligodendrocytes. In isolated mitochondria, VLCFAs exert a detrimental effect by affecting the inner mitochondrial membrane and promoting the permeability transition. In conclusion, we suggest that there is a potent toxic activity of VLCFA due to dramatic cell physiological effects with mitochondrial dysfunction and Ca2 deregulation. This provides the first evidence for mitochondrial-based cell death mechanisms in neurodegenerative disease with peroxisomal defects and subsequent VLCFA accumulation. {\textcopyright} The Author 2008.

abstract = {Peroxisomes contain numerous enzymatic activities that are important for mammalian physiology. Patients lacking either all peroxisomal functions or a single enzyme or transporter function typically develop severe neurological deficits, which originate from aberrant development of the brain, demyelination and loss of axonal integrity, neuroinflammation or other neurodegenerative processes. Whilst correlating peroxisomal properties with a compilation of pathologies observed in human patients and mouse models lacking all or individual peroxisomal functions, we discuss the importance of peroxisomal metabolites and tissue- and cell type-specific contributions to the observed brain pathologies. This enables us to deconstruct the local and systemic contribution of individual metabolic pathways to specific brain functions. We also review the recently discovered variability of pathological symptoms in cases with unexpectedly mild presentation of peroxisome biogenesis disorders. Finally, we explore the emerging evidence linking peroxisomes to more common neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, autism and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Here we review the interplay between oxidative stress and axonal degeneration, taking as groundwork recent findings on pathomechanisms of the peroxisomal neurometabolic disease adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD). We explore the impact of chronic redox imbalance caused by the excess of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) on mitochondrial respiration and biogenesis, and discuss how this impairs protein quality control mechanisms essential for neural cell survival, such as the proteasome and autophagy systems. As consequence, prime molecular targets in the pathogenetic cascade emerge, such as the SIRT1/PGC-1$\alpha$ axis of mitochondrial biogenesis, and the inhibitor of autophagy mTOR. Thus, we propose that mitochondria-targeted antioxidants; mitochondrial biogenesis boosters such as the antidiabetic pioglitazone and the SIRT1 ligand resveratrol; and the autophagy activator temsirolimus, a derivative of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, hold promise as disease-modifying therapies for X-ALD.},
