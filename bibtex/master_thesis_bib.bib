abstract = {Driven by its successes across domains such as computer vision and natural language processing, deep learning has recently entered the field of biology by aiding in cellular image classification, finding genomic connections, and advancing drug discovery. In drug discovery and protein engineering, a major goal is to design a molecule that will perform a useful function as a therapeutic drug. Typically, the focus has been on small molecules, but new approaches have been developed to apply these same principles of deep learning to biologics, such as antibodies. Here we give a brief background of deep learning as it applies to antibody drug development, and an in-depth explanation of several deep learning algorithms that have been proposed to solve aspects of both protein design in general, and antibody design in particular.},

abstract = {In response to pathogens, the adaptive immune system generates specific antibodies that bind and neutralize foreign antigens. Understanding the composition of an individual's immune repertoire can provide insights into this process and reveal potential therapeutic antibodies. In this work, we explore the application of antibody-specific language models to aid understanding of immune repertoires. We introduce AntiBERTy, a language model trained on 558M natural antibody sequences. We find that within repertoires, our model clusters antibodies into trajectories resembling affinity maturation. Importantly, we show that models trained to predict highly redundant sequences under a multiple instance learning framework identify key binding residues in the process. With further development, the methods presented here will provide new insights into antigen binding from repertoire sequences alone.},

@article{Devlin2019,
abstract = {We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5{\%} (7.7{\%} point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

abstract = {Antibodies and antibody-derived macromolecules have established themselves as the mainstay in protein-based therapeutic molecules (biologics). Our knowledge of the structure– function relationships of antibodies provides a platform for protein engineering that has been exploited to generate a wide range of biologics for a host of therapeutic indications. In this review, our basic understanding of the antibody structure is described along with how that knowledge has leveraged the engineering of antibody and antibody-related therapeutics having the appropriate antigen affinity, effector function, and biophysical properties. The platforms examined include the development of antibodies, antibody fragments, bispecific antibody, and antibody fusion products, whose efficacy and manufacturability can be improved via humanization, affinity modulation, and stability enhancement. We also review the design and selection of binding arms, and avidity modulation. Different strategies of preparing bispecific and multispecific molecules for an array of therapeutic applications are included.},

abstract = {Motivation: General protein language models have been shown to summarize the semantics of protein sequences into representations that are useful for state-of-the-art predictive methods. However, for antibody specific problems, such as restoring residues lost due to sequencing errors, a model trained solely on antibodies may be more powerful. Antibodies are one of the few protein types where the volume of sequence data needed for such language models is available, e.g. in the Observed Antibody Space (OAS) database. Results: Here, we introduce AbLang, a language model trained on the antibody sequences in the OAS database. We demonstrate the power of AbLang by using it to restore missing residues in antibody sequence data, a key issue with B-cell receptor repertoire sequencing, e.g. over 40{\%} of OAS sequences are missing the first 15 amino acids. AbLang restores the missing residues of antibody sequences better than using IMGT germlines or the general protein language model ESM-1b. Further, AbLang does not require knowledge of the germline of the antibody and is seven times faster than ESM-1b.},

abstract = {Immunogenicity is an important concern to therapeutic antibodies during antibody design and development. Based on the co-crystal structures of idiotypic antibodies and their antibodies, one can see that anti-idiotypic antibodies usually bind the complementarity-determining regions (CDR) of idiotypic antibodies. Sequence and structural features, such as cavity volume at the CDR region and hydrophobicity of CDR-H3 loop region, were identified for distinguishing immunogenic antibodies from non-immunogenic antibodies. These features were integrated together with a machine learning platform to predict immunogenicity for humanized and fully human therapeutic antibodies (PITHA). This method achieved an accuracy of 83{\%} in a leave-one-out experiment for 29 therapeutic antibodies with available crystal structures. The web server of this method is accessible at http://mabmedicine.com/PITHA or http://sysbio.unl.edu/PITHA. This method, as a step of computer-aided antibody design, helps evaluate the safety of new therapeutic antibody, which can save time and money during the therapeutic antibody development.},

abstract = {Recommending purely cold-start items is a long-standing and fundamental challenge in the recommender systems. Without any historical interaction on cold-start items, the collaborative filtering (CF) scheme fails to leverage collaborative signals to infer user preference on these items. To solve this problem, extensive studies have been conducted to incorporate side information of items (e.g., content features) into the CF scheme. Specifically, they employ modern neural network techniques (e.g., dropout, consistency constraint) to discover and exploit the coalition effect of content features and collaborative representations. However, we argue that these works less explore the mutual dependencies between content features and collaborative representations and lack sufficient theoretical supports, thus resulting in unsatisfactory performance on cold-start recommendation. In this work, we reformulate the cold-start item representation learning from an information-theoretic standpoint. It aims to maximize the mutual dependencies between item content and collaborative signals. Specifically, the representation learning is theoretically lower-bounded by the integration of two terms: mutual information between collaborative embeddings of users and items, and mutual information between collaborative embeddings and feature representations of items. To model such a learning process, we devise a new objective function founded upon contrastive learning and develop a simple yet effective Contrastive Learning-based Cold-start Recommendation framework (CLCRec). In particular, CLCRec consists ofthree components: contrastive pair organization, contrastive embedding, and contrastive optimization modules. It allows us to preserve collaborative signals in the content representations for both warm and cold-start items. Through extensive experiments on four publicly accessible datasets, we},

@article{Joshi2019,
abstract = {Multiple strategies have been developed to facilitate the efficient production of bispecific IgG (BsIgG) in single host cells. For example, we previously demonstrated near quantitative (≥90{\%}) formation of BsIgG of different species and isotypes by combining ‘knob-into-hole' mutations for heavy chain heterodimerization with engineered antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) for preferential cognate heavy/light chain pairing. Surprisingly, in this study we found high yield ({\textgreater}65{\%}) of BsIgG1 without Fab engineering to be a common occurrence, i.e., observed for 33 of the 99 different antibody pairs evaluated. Installing charge mutations at both CH1/CL interfaces was sufficient for near quantitative yield ({\textgreater}90{\%}) of BsIgG1 for most (9 of 11) antibody pairs tested with this inherent cognate chain pairing preference. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that a strong cognate pairing preference in one Fab arm can be sufficient for high BsIgG1 yield. These observed chain pairing preferences are apparently driven by variable domain sequences and can result from a few specific residues in the complementarity-determining region (CDR) L3 and H3. Transfer of these CDR residues into other antibodies increased BsIgG1 yield in most cases. Mutational analysis revealed that the disulfide bond between heavy and light chains did not affect the yield of BsIgG1. This study provides some mechanistic understanding of factors contributing to antibody heavy/light chain pairing preference and subsequently contributes to the efficient production of BsIgG in single host cells.},
annote = {This abstract discusses the creation of a type of antibody, known as bispecific IgG (BsIgG), which can target two different antigens at the same time. This is achieved by engineering antibodies in a way that allows them to pair up correctly in a single cell to form BsIgG efficiently.

The researchers previously showed that by making specific changes (called "knob-into-hole" mutations) to part of the antibody structure and modifying another part (the antigen-binding fragments, or Fabs), they could make different kinds of BsIgGs at a high rate of success (over 90{\%}). However, they were surprised to find that without modifying the Fabs, they still managed to produce a high yield (over 65{\%}) of a specific kind of BsIgG (BsIgG1) in 33 out of 99 antibody pair combinations they tested.

Further, they discovered that introducing charge changes at certain points of the antibody was enough to significantly increase the production yield (over 90{\%}) for most antibody pairs tested, suggesting that some antibodies naturally pair up correctly more often than others.

The study also found that certain sequences in the antibody are responsible for this natural pairing preference, especially specific parts within the variable domain known as the complementarity-determining region (CDR) L3 and H3. By transferring these specific sequences to other antibodies, the production yield of BsIgG1 was improved in most cases.

Interestingly, the presence of a disulfide bond, which links the heavy and light chains of an antibody, did not impact the production yield of BsIgG1.

This research helps understand how antibodies pair together, which is useful for producing bispecific antibodies more efficiently in single cells.},
