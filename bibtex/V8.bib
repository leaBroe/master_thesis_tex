abstract = {In this review, we discuss the structural and functional diversity of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) based primarily on protein families for which three-dimensional structural data are available. PPIs play diverse roles in biology and differ based on the composition, affinity and whether the association is permanent or transient. In vivo, the protomer's localization, concentration and local environment can affect the interaction between protomers and are vital to control the composition and oligomeric state of protein complexes. Since a change in quaternary state is often coupled with biological function or activity, transient PPIs are important biological regulators. Structural characteristics of different types of PPIs are discussed and related to their physiological function, specificity and evolution.},

abstract = {"Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry ... brings clarity and coherence to an often unwieldy discipline, offering a thoroughly updated survey of biochemistry's enduring principles, definitive discoveries, and groundbreaking new advances with each edition.This new Seventh Edition maintains the qualities that have distinguished the text since Albert Lehninger's original edition—clear writing, careful explanations of difficult concepts, helpful problem-solving support, and insightful communication of contemporary biochemistry's core ideas, new techniques, and pivotal discoveries. Again, David Nelson and Michael Cox introduce students to an extraordinary amount of exciting new findings without an overwhelming amount of extra discussion or detail." -- Publisher description.},
