@article{10.1242/jcs.115.1.3,
abstract = {Microtubules are highly dynamic and switch stochastically between growing and shrinking phases both in vivo and in vitro. This non-equilibrium behavior, known as dynamic instability, is based on the binding and hydrolysis of GTP at the nucleotide exchangeable site (E-site) in $\beta$-tubulin. Only dimers that have GTP in their E-site can polymerize (red tubulin subunits), but following polymerization this nucleotide is hydrolyzed and becomes non-exchangeable. The GTP-cap model proposes that the body of the microtubule, which comprises GDP-tubulin subunits (pale red), is unstable. The microtubule structure is stabilized by a layer of GTP tubulin subunits at the end that may act to maintain association between protofilaments. When this cap is stochastically lost, the protofilaments peel outward and the microtubule rapidly depolymerizes.},

@article{Tully2003,
abstract = {Today, the clinical notion of 'memory disorder' is largely synonymous with 'Alzheimer's disease.' Only 50{\%} of all dementias are of the Alzheimer's type though, and dementias represent only the more severe of all learning/memory disorders that derive from heredity, disease, injury or age. Perhaps as many as 30 million Americans suffer some type of clinically recognized memory disorder. To date, therapeutic drugs of only one class have been approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Fortunately, basic research during the past 25 years has begun to define a 'chemistry of brain plasticity,' which is suggesting new gene targets for the discovery of memory enhancers.},

@article{Sunyer2008,
abstract = {Learning and memory depend on molecular mechanisms involving the protein machinery. Recent evidence proposes that post-translational modifications (PTMs) play a major role in these cognitive processes. PTMs including phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyro-sine are already well-documented to play a role for synaptic plasticity of the brain, neuro-transmitter release, vesicle trafficking and synaptosomal or synaptosomal-associated proteins are substrates of a series of specific protein kinases and their counterparts, protein phosphatases. But protein phosphorylation is only one out of many possible PTMs and first work shows a role of palmitoylation as well as glycosylation for proteins involved in memory formation. Recent technology may now allow reliable detection and even quantification of PTMs of proteins involved in the cognitive system. This will contribute to the understanding of mechanisms for learning and memory formation at the chemical level and has to complement determination of protein levels and indeed determination of protein expression per se generates limited information. The many other PTMs expected including protein nitrosylation and alkylation will even represent targets for pharmacological interventions but in turn increase the complexity of the system. Nevertheless, determination of the presence and the function of PTMs is mandatory and promising cognitive research at the protein chemical level.},
