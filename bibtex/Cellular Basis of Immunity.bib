abstract = {Life-threatening fungal infections have risen sharply in recent years, owing to the advances and intensity of medical care that may blunt immunity in patients. This emerging crisis has created the growing need to clarify immune defense mechanisms against fungi with the ultimate goal of therapeutic intervention. We describe recent insights in understanding the mammalian immune defenses that are deployed against pathogenic fungi. We focus on adaptive immunity to the major medically important fungi and emphasize three elements that coordinate the response: (1) dendritic cells and subsets that are mobilized against fungi in various anatomical compartments; (2) fungal molecular patterns and their corresponding receptors that signal responses and shape the differentiation of T-cell subsets and B cells; and, ultimately (3) the effector and regulatory mechanisms that eliminate these invaders while constraining collateral damage to vital tissue. These insights create a foundation for the development of new, immune-based strategies for prevention or enhanced clearance of systemic fungal diseases.},

abstract = {Genetic differences are hypothesized to underlie ethnic disparities in incidence rates of the endemic systemic mycoses, including blastomycosis. Individuals of Hmong ancestry display elevated risk for this serious fungal infection. Here, we interrogated the genomes of Wisconsin (WI) Hmong blastomycosis patients using homozygosity mapping to uncover regions of the genome that are likely shared among the greater Hmong population and filtered for variants with high potential to affect disease susceptibility. This approach uncovered 113 candidate susceptibility variants, and among the most promising are those in genes involved in the interleukin-17 (IL-17) response. In particular, we identified 25 linked variants near the gene encoding IL-6 (IL6). We validated differences in cytokine production between Hmong and European volunteers and formally demonstrated a critical role for IL-6 in the development of adaptive immunity to Blastomyces dermatitidis. Our findings suggest that the dysregulation of IL-17 responses underlies a recently reported and poorly understood ethnic health disparity. IMPORTANCE Blastomycosis is a potentially life-threatening infection caused by the fungus Blastomyces dermatitidis. As with related fungal diseases, blastomycosis is noted to affect some populations more than others. These patterns of illness are often not related to predisposing conditions or exposure risks; thus, genetic differences are thought to underlie these health disparities. People of Hmong ancestry in Wisconsin are at elevated risk of blastomycosis compared to the general population. We studied the genetic codes of Hmong blastomycosis patients and identified candidate sites in their genomes that may explain their susceptibility to this infection. We further studied one particular region of the genome that is involved with the immune processes that fight B. dermatitidis. Our work revealed population differences in the response to fungi. A better understanding of the genetic underpinnings of susceptibility to infectious diseases has broader implications for community health, especially in the paradigm of personalized medicine.},

abstract = {Phagocytosis-the process by which macrophages, dendritic cells and other myeloid phagocytes internalize diverse particulate targets-is a key mechanism of innate immunity. The molecular and cellular events that underlie the binding of targets to a phagocyte and their engulfment into phagosomes have been extensively studied. More recent data suggest that the process of phagocytosis itself provides information to myeloid phagocytes about the nature of the targets they are engulfing and that this helps to tailor inflammatory responses. In this Review, we discuss how such information is acquired during phagocytosis and how it is processed to coordinate an immune response. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {The complement system has been considered for a long time as a simple lytic cascade, aimed to kill bacteria infecting the host organism. Nowadays, this vision has changed and it is well accepted that complement is a complex innate immune surveillance system, playing a key role in host homeostasis, inflammation, and in the defense against pathogens. This review discusses recent advances in the understanding of the role of complement in physiology and pathology. It starts with a description of complement contribution to the normal physiology (homeostasis) of a healthy organism, including the silent clearance of apoptotic cells and maintenance of cell survival. In pathology, complement can be a friend or a foe. It acts as a friend in the defense against pathogens, by inducing opsonization and a direct killing by C5b-9 membrane attack complex and by triggering inflammatory responses with the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a. Opsonization plays also a major role in the mounting of an adaptive immune response, involving antigen presenting cells, T-, and B-lymphocytes. Nevertheless, it can be also an enemy, when pathogens hijack complement regulators to protect themselves from the immune system. Inadequate complement activation becomes a disease cause, as in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, C3 glomerulopathies, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Age-related macular degeneration and cancer will be described as examples showing that complement contributes to a large variety of conditions, far exceeding the classical examples of diseases associated with complement deficiencies. Finally, we discuss complement as a therapeutic target.},
