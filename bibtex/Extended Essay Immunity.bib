abstract = {The major reasons for developing human monoclonal antibodies were to be able to efficiently manipulate their effector functions while avoiding immunogenicity seen with rodent antibodies. Those effector functions involve interactions with the complement system and naturally occurring Fc receptors on diverse blood white cells. Antibody immunogenicity results from the degree to which the host immune system can recognize and react to these therapeutic agents. Thus far, there is still no generally applicable technology guaranteed to render therapeutic antibodies antigenically silent. This is not to say that the task is impossible, but rather that we need to train the immune system to help us. This can be achieved if we take advantage of natural mechanisms by which an individual can be rendered tolerant of ``foreign'' antigens, and as a corollary minimize the potential immunogenicity of any contaminating protein aggregates, or ``aggregates'' arising from antibodies complexing with their antigen. I here summarize our efforts to engineer antibodies to harness optimal effector functions, while also minimizing their immunogenicity. Potential avenues to achieve the latte are predicted from classical work showing that monomeric ``foreign'' immunoglobulins are good tolerogens, while aggregates of immunoglobulins ate intrinsically immunogenic. Consequently, I argue that one solution to the immunogenicity problem lies in ensuring a temporal quantitative advantage of tolerogenic non-cell-bound monomer over the cell-binding immunogenic form.},

abstract = {Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have become one of the most important classes of biopharmaceutical products, and they continue to dominate the universe of biopharmaceutical markets in terms of approval and sales. They are the most profitable single product class, where they represent six of the top ten selling drugs. At the beginning of the 1990s, an in vitro antibody selection technology known as antibody phage display was developed by John McCafferty and Sir. Gregory Winter that enabled the discovery of human antibodies for diverse applications, particularly antibody-based drugs. They created combinatorial antibody libraries on filamentous phage to be utilized for generating antigen specific antibodies in a matter of weeks. Since then, more than 70 phage–derived antibodies entered clinical studies and 14 of them have been approved. These antibodies are indicated for cancer, and non-cancer medical conditions, such as inflammatory, optical, infectious, or immunological diseases. This review will illustrate the utility of phage display as a powerful platform for therapeutic antibodies discovery and describe in detail all the approved mAbs derived from phage display.},

abstract = {The isolation of single monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against a given antigen was only possible with the introduction of the hybridoma technology, which is based on the fusion of specific B lymphocytes with myeloma cells. Since then, several mAbs were described for therapeutic, diagnostic, and research purposes. Despite being an old technique with low complexity, hybridoma-based strategies have limitations that include the low efficiency on B lymphocyte-myeloma cell fusion step, and the need to use experimental animals. In face of that, several methods have been developed to improve mAb generation, ranging from changes in hybridoma technique to the advent of completely new technologies, such as the antibody phage display and the single B cell antibody ones. In this review, we discuss the hybridoma technology along with emerging mAb isolation approaches, taking into account their advantages and limitations. Finally, we explore the usefulness of the hybridoma technology nowadays.},

abstract = {Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have become a cornerstone in the therapeutic guidelines of a wide range of solid tumors. The targeted nature of these biotherapeutics has improved treatment outcomes by offering enhanced specificity to reduce severe side effects experienced with conventional chemotherapy. Notwithstanding, poor tumor tissue penetration and the heterogeneous distribution achieved therein are prominent drawbacks that hamper the clinical efficacy of therapeutic antibodies. Failure to deliver efficacious doses throughout the tumor can lead to treatment failure and the development of acquired resistance mechanisms. Comprehending the morphological and physiological characteristics of solid tumors and their microenvironment that affect tumor penetration and distribution is a key requirement to improve clinical outcomes and realize the full potential of monoclonal antibodies in oncology. This review summarizes the essential architectural characteristics of solid tumors that obstruct macromolecule penetration into the targeted tissue following systemic delivery. It further describes mechanisms of resistance elucidated for blockbuster antibodies for which extensive clinical data exists, as a way to illustrate various modes in which cancer cells can overcome the anticancer activity of therapeutic antibodies. Thereafter, it describes novel strategies designed to improve clinical outcomes of mAbs by increasing potency and/or improving tumor delivery; focusing on the recent clinical success and growing clinical pipeline of antibody-drug conjugates, immune checkpoint inhibitors and nanoparticle-based delivery systems.},

Influenza virus is one of the most common causes of acute lower respiratory tract infections worldwide.Individuals suffering from severe viral respiratory tract infections have recently emerged as “at risk” groups for developing invasive fungal infections. Influenza virus is one of the most common causes of acute lower respiratory tract infections worldwide. Fungal infections complicating influenza pneumonia are associated with increased disease severity and mortality, with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis being the most common manifestation. Strikingly, similar observations have been made during the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The copathogenesis of respiratory viral and fungal coinfections is complex and involves a dynamic interplay between the host immune defenses and the virulence of the microbes involved that often results in failure to return to homeostasis. In this review, we discuss the main mechanisms underlying susceptibility to invasive fungal disease following respiratory viral infections. A comprehensive understanding of these interactions will aid the development of therapeutic modalities against newly identified targets to prevent and treat these emerging coinfections.},
