abstract = {Motivation: The emergence of high-throughput sequencing technologies revolutionized genomics in early 2000s. The next revolution came with the era of long-read sequencing. These technological advances along with novel computational approaches became the next step towards the automatic pipelines capable to assemble nearly complete mammalian-size genomes. Results: In this manuscript, we demonstrate performance of the state-of-the-art genome assembly software on six eukaryotic datasets sequenced using different technologies. To evaluate the results, we developed QUAST-LG?a tool that compares large genomic de novo assemblies against reference sequences and computes relevant quality metrics. Since genomes generally cannot be reconstructed completely due to complex repeat patterns and low coverage regions, we introduce a concept of upper bound assembly for a given genome and set of reads, and compute theoretical limits on assembly correctness and completeness. Using QUAST-LG, we show how close the assemblies are to the theoretical optimum, and how far this optimum is from the finished reference.},

@article{tesorter,
abstract = {† These authors contributed equally to this work. Dear Editor, Transposable elements (TEs) constitute the largest portion of repetitive sequences in many eukaryotic genomes, with long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) being predominant in plant genomes. Various tools have been developed for the identification and classification of TEs, including RepeatModeler [1], REPET [2], LTR{\_}retriever (https://github.com/oushujun/LTR{\_}retriever), and TERL (https://github.com/muriloHoracio/TERL). To our knowledge , most existing software can only classify TEs to the superfamily level, in particular the LTR-RT Copia and Gyspy superfamilies in plants, leaving a significant knowledge gap. Moreover, although approaches for automated classification of LTR lineages using amino acid hidden Markov models (HMMs) do exist, these are typically comprised of collections of scripts that are not curated or specifically designed to be user-friendly. Previous studies have proposed classifications of LTR-RTs at the clade level [3]. Neumann et al. [4] classified the Copia superfamily into the Ale, Alesia, Angela, Bianca, Bryco, Lyco, Gymco I-IV, Ikeros, Ivana, Osser, SIRE, TAR, and Tork clades and the Gypsy superfamily into the CRM, Chlamyvir, Galadriel, Tcn1, Reina, Tekay, Athila, Tat I-III, Ogre, Retand, Phygy, and Selgy clades. These studies provide protein domain databases for clade-level LTR-RT classifications. Moreover, a recent update of REXdb [4] also provides classifications for other TEs, such as long interspersed nuclear repeats (LINEs), terminal inverted repeats (TIRs), and Helitrons (http://repeatexplorer.org/? page{\_}id=918). We employed previous classifications of conserved protein domains to develop an automated, easy-to-use, and accurate classifier, named TEsorter. This software can be used to perform superfamily-level classification of TEs and to further classify LTR-RTs into clades. The Python code is freely available at https://github.com/ zhangrengang/TEsorter. The TEsorter package is implemented in Python3 and supports multiprocessing to reduce runtime. The conda approach is also supported to enable easier installation and better integration with other workflows. TEsorter was implemented using HMM profiles obtained from the TE protein domain databases GyDB (http://gydb.o rg) and REXdb [4]. For REXdb, multiple sequence alignments of domains of each clade were performed using MAFFT (https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/) and HMM profiles were generated with HMMBuild [5]. To classify TE sequences, they are first translated in all six frames and the translated sequences are then searched against one of the two databases using HMM-Scan [5]. Hits with coverage {\textless}20{\%} or E-value {\textgreater}1e-3 are discarded. For domains with multiple hits, only the best hit with the highest score is retained (Figure 1a). The classifications of TE superfamilies (e.g. LTR/Copia, LTR/Gyspy) and clades (e.g. Reina and CRM of Gypsy) are based directly on hits. For the Copia and Gyspy superfamilies, complete elements are identified based on the presence and order of conserved domains, including capsid protein (GAG), aspartic proteinase (AP), integrase (INT), reverse tran-scriptase (RT), and RNase H (RH), as described in Wicker et al. [6]. Mutations such as frameshifts and domain losses may interfere with HMM-based classifications. To improve},

@article{Jiao2020,
abstract = {Despite hundreds of sequenced Arabidopsis genomes, very little is known about the degree of genomic collinearity within single species, due to the low number of chromosome-level assemblies. Here, we report chromosome-level reference-quality assemblies of seven Arabidopsis thaliana accessions selected across its global range. Each genome reveals between 13–17 Mb rearranged, and 5–6 Mb non-reference sequences introducing copy-number changes in {\~{}}5000 genes, including {\~{}}1900 non-reference genes. Quantifying the collinearity between the genomes reveals {\~{}}350 euchromatic regions, where accession-specific tandem duplications destroy the collinearity between the genomes. These hotspots of rearrangements are characterized by reduced meiotic recombination in hybrids and genes implicated in biotic stress response. This suggests that hotspots of rearrangements undergo altered evolutionary dynamics, as compared to the rest of the genome, which are mostly based on the accumulation of new mutations and not on the recombination of existing variation, and thereby enable a quick response to the biotic stress.},

@article{genespace,
abstract = {The development of multiple chromosome-scale reference genome sequences in many taxonomic groups has yielded a high-resolution view of the patterns and processes of molecular evolution. Nonetheless, leveraging information across multiple genomes remains a significant challenge in nearly all eukaryotic systems. These challenges range from studying the evolution of chromosome structure, to finding candidate genes for quantitative trait loci, to testing hypotheses about speciation and adaptation. Here, we present GENESPACE, which addresses these challenges by integrating conserved gene order and orthology to define the expected physical position of all genes across multiple genomes. We demonstrate this utility by dissecting presence–absence, copy-number, and structural variation at three levels of biological organization: spanning 300 million years of vertebrate sex chromosome evolution, across the diversity of the Poaceae (grass) plant family, and among 26 maize cultivars. The methods to build and visualize syntenic orthology in the GENESPACE R package offer a significant addition to existing gene family and synteny programs, especially in polyploid, outbred, and other complex genomes.},

@article{edta,
abstract = {Background: Sequencing technology and assembly algorithms have matured to the point that high-quality De novo assembly is possible for large, repetitive genomes. Current assemblies traverse transposable elements (TEs) and provide an opportunity for comprehensive annotation of TEs. Numerous methods exist for annotation of each class of TEs, but their relative performances have not been systematically compared. Moreover, a comprehensive pipeline is needed to produce a non-redundant library of TEs for species lacking this resource to generate whole-genome TE annotations. Results: We benchmark existing programs based on a carefully curated library of rice TEs. We evaluate the performance of methods annotating long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, terminal inverted repeat (TIR) transposons, short TIR transposons known as miniature inverted transposable elements (MITEs), and Helitrons. Performance metrics include sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, FDR, and F 1. Using the most robust programs, we create a comprehensive pipeline called Extensive de-novo TE Annotator (EDTA) that produces a filtered non-redundant TE library for annotation of structurally intact and fragmented elements. EDTA also deconvolutes nested TE insertions frequently found in highly repetitive genomic regions. Using other model species with curated TE libraries (maize and Drosophila), EDTA is shown to be robust across both plant and animal species. Conclusions: The benchmarking results and pipeline developed here will greatly facilitate TE annotation in eukaryotic genomes. These annotations will promote a much more in-depth understanding of the diversity and evolution of TEs at both intra- and inter-species levels. EDTA is open-source and freely available: https://github.com/oushujun/EDTA.},

@article{Herbert2016,
abstract = {During the late Miocene epoch, about seven million years ago, large areas of the continents experienced drying, enhanced seasonality, and a restructuring of terrestrial plant and animal communities. These changes are seen throughout the subtropics, but have typically been attributed to regional tectonic forcing. Here we present a set of globally distributed sea surface temperature records spanning the past 12 million years based on the alkenone unsaturation method. We find that a sustained late Miocene cooling occurred synchronously in both hemispheres, and culminated with ocean temperatures dipping to near-modern values between about 7 and 5.4 million years ago. The period of maximum cooling coincides with evidence for transient glaciations in the Northern Hemisphere and with a steepening of the pole-to-equator temperature gradient, as well. We thus infer that late Miocene aridity and terrestrial ecosystem changes occurred in a global context of increasing meridional temperature gradients. We conclude that a global forcing mechanism, such as the previously hypothesized decline in atmospheric CO2 levels between eight and six million years ago, is required to explain the late Miocene changes in temperature, climate and ecosystems. A period of continental aridification and ecosystem change occurred about seven million years ago. A global sea surface temperature reconstruction identifies cooling temperatures and a strengthened meridional temperature gradient at this time.},

Pilon works with many types of sequence data, but is particularly strong when supplied with paired end data from two Illumina libraries with small e.g., 180 bp and large e.g., 3–5 Kb inserts. Pilon significantly improves draft genome assemblies by correcting bases, fixing mis-assemblies and filling gaps. For both haploid and diploid genomes, Pilon produces more contiguous genomes with fewer errors, enabling identification of more biologically relevant genes. Furthermore, Pilon identifies small variants with high accuracy as compared to state-of-the-art tools and is unique in its ability to accurately identify large sequence variants including duplications and resolve large insertions. Pilon is being used to improve the assemblies of thousands of new genomes and to identify variants from thousands of clinically relevant bacterial strains.

@article{maker,
abstract = {We have developed a portable and easily configurable genome annotation pipeline called MAKER. Its purpose is to allow investigators to independently annotate eukaryotic genomes and create genome databases. MAKER identifies repeats, aligns ESTs and proteins to a genome, produces ab initio gene predictions, and automatically synthesizes these data into gene annotations having evidence-based quality indices. MAKER is also easily trainable: Outputs of preliminary runs are used to automatically retrain its gene-prediction algorithm, producing higher-quality gene-models on subsequent runs. MAKER's inputs are minimal, and its outputs can be used to create a GMOD database. Its outputs can also be viewed in the Apollo Genome browser; this feature of MAKER provides an easy means to annotate, view, and edit individual contigs and BACs without the overhead of a database. As proof of principle, we have used MAKER to annotate the genome of the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea and to create a new genome database, SmedGD. We have also compared MAKER's performance to other published annotation pipelines. Our results demonstrate that MAKER provides a simple and effective means to convert a genome sequence into a community-accessible genome database. MAKER should prove especially useful for emerging model organism genome projects for which extensive bioinformatics resources may not be readily available. {\textcopyright}2008 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

We benchmark Flye against five state-of-the-art assemblers and show that it generates better or comparable assemblies, while being an order of magnitude faster. Flye nearly doubled the contiguity of the human genome assembly (as measured by the NGA50 assembly quality metric) compared with existing assemblers. Flye improves the speed and accuracy of genome assembly by using repeat graphs to resolve repeat regions.},

@article{Roveri2014,
abstract = {Forty years after the image of the Mediterranean transformed into a giant salty lake was first conceived, the fascinating history of the Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC) still arouses great interest across a large and diverse scientific community. Early outcrop studies which identified severe palaeoenvironmental changes affecting the circum-Mediterranean at the end of the Miocene, were followed by investigations of the marine geology during the 1950s to 1970s. These were fundamental to understanding the true scale and importance of the Messinian event. Now, after a long period of debate over several entrenched but largely untested hypotheses, a unifying stratigraphic framework of MSC events has been constructed. This scenario is derived mainly from onshore data and observations, but incorporates different perspectives for the offshore and provides hypotheses that can be tested by drilling the deep Mediterranean basins. The MSC was an ecological crisis, induced by a powerful combination of geodynamic and climatic drivers, which had a great impact on the subsequent geological history of the Mediterranean area, and on the salinity of the global oceans. These changed the Mediterranean's connections with both the Atlantic Ocean and the freshwater Paratethyan basins, causing high-amplitude fluctuations in the hydrology of the Mediterranean. The MSC developed in three main stages, each of them characterized by different palaeoenvironmental conditions. During the first stage, evaporites precipitated in shallow sub-basins; the MSC peaked in the second stage, when evaporite precipitation shifted to the deepest depocentres; and the third stage was characterized by large-scale environmental fluctuations in a Mediterranean transformed into a brackish water lake. The very high-resolution timescale available for some Late Miocene intervals in the Mediterranean makes it possible to consider environmental variability on extremely short time scales including, in some places, annual changes. Despite this, fundamental questions remain, some of which could be answered through new cores from the deepest Mediterranean basins. Improvements in seismic imaging and drilling techniques over the last few decades make it possible to plan to core the entire basinal Messinian succession for the first time. The resulting data would allow us to decipher the causes of this extreme environmental change and its global-scale consequences. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Our analyses revealed the distinct evolutionary dynamics of Gypsy retrotransposons, which reflects the different patterns of genome size changes of the four species over the past million years. The rate of Gypsy transposition in Aly is approximately five times more rapid than that of Ath and Esa, suggesting an expanding Aly genome. Gypsy insertions in Esa are strictly confined to pericentromeric heterochromatin and associated with dramatic centromere expansion. In contrast, Gypsy insertions in Spa have been largely suppressed over the last million years, likely as a result of a combination of an inherent molecular mechanism of preferential DNA removal and purifying selection at Gypsy elements. Additionally, species-specific clades of Gypsy elements shaped the distinct genome architectures of Aly and Esa.},

abstract = {Angiosperms have become the dominant terrestrial plant group by diversifying for {\~{}}145 million years into a broad range of environments. During the course of evolution, numerous morphological innovations arose, often preceded by whole genome duplications (WGD). The mustard family (Brassicaceae), a successful angiosperm clade with {\~{}}4000 species, has been diversifying into many evolutionary lineages for more than 30 million years. Here we develop a species inventory, analyze morphological variation, and present a maternal, plastome-based genus-level phylogeny. We show that increased morphological disparity, despite an apparent absence of clade-specific morphological innovations, is found in tribes with WGDs or diversification rate shifts. Both are important processes in Brassicaceae, resulting in an overall high net diversification rate. Character states show frequent and independent gain and loss, and form varying combinations. Therefore, Brassicaceae pave the way to concepts of phylogenetic genome-wide association studies to analyze the evolution of morphological form and function. As one of the most successful angiosperm clades with {\~{}}4000 species, the mustard family has been diversifying into many evolutionary lineages. Here, the authors construct plastid-based phylogeny and show nested whole-genome duplications coincide with diversification and high morphological disparity.},

abstract = {FASTA and FASTQ are basic and ubiquitous formats for storing nucleotide and protein sequences. Common manipulations of FASTA/Q file include converting, searching, filtering, deduplication, splitting, shuffling, and sampling. Existing tools only implement some of these manipulations, and not particularly efficiently, and some are only available for certain operating systems. Furthermore, the complicated installation process of required packages and running environments can render these programs less user friendly. This paper describes a cross-platform ultrafast comprehensive toolkit for FASTA/Q processing. SeqKit provides executable binary files for all major operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX, and can be directly used without any dependencies or pre-configurations. SeqKit demonstrates competitive performance in execution time and memory usage compared to similar tools. The efficiency and usability of SeqKit enable researchers to rapidly accomplish common FASTA/Q file manipulations.

abstract = {Background: Plant LTR-retrotransposons are classified into two superfamilies, Ty1/copia and Ty3/gypsy. They are further divided into an enormous number of families which are, due to the high diversity of their nucleotide sequences, usually specific to a single or a group of closely related species. Previous attempts to group these families into broader categories reflecting their phylogenetic relationships were limited either to analyzing a narrow range of plant species or to analyzing a small numbers of elements. Furthermore, there is no reference database that allows for similarity based classification of LTR-retrotransposons. Results: We have assembled a database of retrotransposon encoded polyprotein domains sequences extracted from 5410 Ty1/copia elements and 8453 Ty3/gypsy elements sampled from 80 species representing major groups of green plants (Viridiplantae). Phylogenetic analysis of the three most conserved polyprotein domains (RT, RH and INT) led to dividing Ty1/copia and Ty3/gypsy retrotransposons into 16 and 14 lineages respectively. We also characterized various features of LTR-retrotransposon sequences including additional polyprotein domains, extra open reading frames and primer binding sites, and found that the occurrence and/or type of these features correlates with phylogenies inferred from the three protein domains. Conclusions: We have established an improved classification system applicable to LTR-retrotransposons from a wide range of plant species. This system reflects phylogenetic relationships as well as distinct sequence and structural features of the elements. A comprehensive database of retrotransposon protein domains (REXdb) that reflects this classification provides a reference for efficient and unified annotation of LTR-retrotransposons in plant genomes. Access to REXdb related tools is implemented in the RepeatExplorer web server (https://repeatexplorer-elixir.cerit-sc.cz/) or using a standalone version of REXdb that can be downloaded seaparately from RepeatExplorer web page (http://repeatexplorer.org/).},

Here we present the Trinity method for de novo assembly of full-length transcripts and evaluate it on samples from fission yeast, mouse and whitefly, whose reference genome is not yet available. By efficiently constructing and analyzing sets of de Bruijn graphs, Trinity fully reconstructs a large fraction of transcripts, including alternatively spliced isoforms and transcripts from recently duplicated genes. Compared with other de novo transcriptome assemblers, Trinity recovers more full-length transcripts across a broad range of expression levels, with a sensitivity similar to methods that rely on genome alignments. Our approach provides a unified solution for transcriptome reconstruction in any sample, especially in the absence of a reference genome. {\textcopyright} 2011 Nature America, Inc.

@article{Cheng2014,
abstract = {The genus Brassica belongs to the plant family Brassicaceae, which includes many important crop species that are used as oilseed, condiments, or vegetables throughout the world. Brassica plants comprise many diverse species, and each species contains rich morphotypes showing extreme traits. Brassica species experienced an extra whole genome triplication (WGT) event compared with the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Whole genome sequencing of the Brassica species Brassica rapa, Brassica oleracea and others demonstrated that WGT plays an important role in the speciation and morphotype diversification of Brassica plants. Comparative genomic analysis based on the genome sequences of B. rapa and A. thaliana clearly identified the WGT event and further demonstrated that the translocated Proto-Calepine Karyotype (tPCK, n=7) was the diploid ancestor of the three subgenomes in B. rapa. Following WGT, subsequent extensive genome fractionation, block reshuffling and chromosome reduction accompanied by paleocentromere descent from the three tPCK subgenomes during the rediploidization process produced stable diploid species. Genomic rearrangement of the diploid species and their hybridization then contributed to Brassica speciation. The subgenome dominance effect and biased gene retention, such as the over-retention of auxin-related genes after WGT, promoted functional gene evolution and thus propelled the expansion of rich morphotypes in the Brassica species. In conclusion, the WGT event initiated subsequent genomic and gene-level evolution, which further drove Brassica speciation and created rich morphotypes in each species. Genome sequencing reveals the mechanisms underlying the diversity of Brassica, a plant genus with an astonishingly wide range of forms. Brassica (including turnips, cabbage and rapeseed) has triple the number of chromosomes of its closest relatives. Xiaowu Wang and colleagues at the Institute of Flowers and Vegetables in Beijing review the effects of this ancient whole-genome triplication (WGT) and describe how it underlies the evolution of both new species and morphological diversity in Brassica. The WGT initiated reorganisation of the entire genome, generating new species, while retention and differentiation of genes gained during the WGT, such as those coding for hormones, drove the evolution of new characteristics like swollen roots, leafy heads and oil-rich seeds. Understanding this genomic history may provide keys to future genetic improvement of cultivated Brassica.},

@article{fasttree,
abstract = {Gene families are growing rapidly, but standard methods for inferring phylogenies do not scale to alignments with over 10,000 sequences. We present FastTree, a method for constructing large phylogenies and for estimating their reliability. Instead of storing a distance matrix, FastTree stores sequence profiles of internal nodes in the tree. FastTree uses these profiles to implement Neighbor-Joining and uses heuristics to quickly identify candidate joins. FastTree then uses nearest neighbor interchanges to reduce the length of the tree. For an alignment with N sequences, L sites, and a different characters, a distance matrix requires O(N 2) space and O(N 2L) time, but FastTree requires just O(NLa + N) memory and O(Nlog (N)La) time. To estimate the tree's reliability, FastTree uses local bootstrapping, which gives another 100-fold speedup over a distance matrix. For example, FastTree computed a tree and support values for 158,022 distinct 16S ribosomal RNAs in 17 h and 2.4 GB of memory. Just computing pairwise Jukes-Cantor distances and storing them, without inferring a tree or bootstrapping, would require 17 h and 50 GB of memory. In simulations, FastTree was slightly more accurate than Neighbor-Joining, BIONJ, or FastME; on genuine alignments, FastTree's topologies had higher likelihoods.

abstract = {Long-read single-molecule sequencing has revolutionized de novo genome assembly and enabled the automated reconstruction of reference-quality genomes. However, given the relatively high error rates of such technologies, efficient and accurate assembly of large repeats and closely related haplotypes remains challenging. We address these issues with Canu, a successor of Celera Assembler that is specifically designed for noisy single-molecule sequences. Canu introduces support for nanopore sequencing, halves depth-of-coverage requirements, and improves assembly continuity while simultaneously reducing runtime by an order of magnitude on large genomes versus Celera Assembler 8.2. These advances result from new overlapping and assembly algorithms, including an adaptive overlapping strategy based on tf-idf weighted MinHash and a sparse assembly graph construction that avoids collapsing diverged repeats and haplotypes. We demonstrate that Canu can reliably assemble complete microbial genomes and near-complete eukaryotic chromosomes using either Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) or Oxford Nanopore technologies and achieves a contig NG50 of {\textgreater}21 Mbp on both human and Drosophila melanogaster PacBio data sets. For assembly structures that cannot be linearly represented, Canu provides graph-based assembly outputs in graphical fragment assembly (GFA) format for analysis or integration with complementary phasing and scaffolding techniques. The combination of such highly resolved assembly graphs with long-range scaffolding information promises the complete and automated assembly of complex genomes.},

abstract = {The Brassicaceae (Cruciferae) family, owing to its remarkable species, genetic, and physiological diversity as well as its significant economic potential, has become a model for polyploidy and evolutionary studies. Utilizing extensive transcriptome pyrosequencing of diverse taxa, we established a resolved phylogeny of a subset of crucifer species. We elucidated the frequency, age, and phylogenetic position of polyploidy and lineage separation events that have marked the evolutionary history of the Brassicaceae. Besides the well-known ancient $\alpha$ (47 million years ago [Mya]) and $\beta$ (124 Mya) paleopolyploidy events, several species were shown to have undergone a further more recent ({\~{}}7 to 12 Mya) round of genome multiplication. We identified eight whole-genome duplications corresponding to at least five independent neo/mesopolyploidy events. Although the Brassicaceae family evolved from other eudicots at the beginning of the Cenozoic era of the Earth (60 Mya), major diversification occurred only during the Neogene period (0 to 23 Mya). Remarkably, the widespread species divergence, major polyploidy, and lineage separation events during Brassicaceae evolution are clustered in time around epoch transitions characterized by prolonged unstable climatic conditions. The synchronized diversification of Brassicaceae species suggests that polyploid events may have conferred higher adaptability and increased tolerance toward the drastically changing global environment, thus facilitating species radiation. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Society of Plant Biologists.

@article{mummer,
abstract = {The MUMmer system and the genome sequence aligner nucmer included within it are among the most widely used alignment packages in genomics. Since the last major release of MUMmer version 3 in 2004, it has been applied to many types of problems including aligning whole genome sequences, aligning reads to a reference genome, and comparing different assemblies of the same genome. Despite its broad utility, MUMmer3 has limitations that can make it difficult to use for large genomes and for the very large sequence data sets that are common today. In this paper we describe MUMmer4, a substantially improved version of MUMmer that addresses genome size constraints by changing the 32-bit suffix tree data structure at the core of MUMmer to a 48-bit suffix array, and that offers improved speed through parallel processing of input query sequences. With a theoretical limit on the input size of 141Tbp, MUMmer4 can now work with input sequences of any biologically realistic length. We show that as a result of these enhancements, the nucmer program in MUMmer4 is easily able to handle alignments of large genomes; we illustrate this with an alignment of the human and chimpanzee genomes, which allows us to compute that the two species are 98{\%} identical across 96{\%} of their length. With the enhancements described here, MUMmer4 can also be used to efficiently align reads to reference genomes, although it is less sensitive and accurate than the dedicated read aligners. The nucmer aligner in MUMmer4 can now be called from scripting languages such as Perl, Python and Ruby. These improvements make MUMer4 one the most versatile genome alignment packages available.},

@article{Marcais2011,
abstract = {Motivation: Counting the number of occurrences of every k-mer (substring of length k) in a long string is a central subproblem in many applications, including genome assembly, error correction of sequencing reads, fast multiple sequence alignment and repeat detection. Recently, the deep sequence coverage generated by next-generation sequencing technologies has caused the amount of sequence to be processed during a genome project to grow rapidly, and has rendered current k-mer counting tools too slow and memory intensive. At the same time, large multicore computers have become commonplace in research facilities allowing for a new parallel computational paradigm. Results: We propose a new k-mer counting algorithm and associated implementation, called Jellyfish, which is fast and memory efficient. It is based on a multithreaded, lock-free hash table optimized for counting k-mers up to 31 bases in length. Due to their flexibility, suffix arrays have been the data structure of choice for solving many string problems. For the task of k-mer counting, important in many biological applications, Jellyfish offers a much faster and more memory-efficient solution. {\textcopyright} The Author 2011.

@article{clustalomega,
abstract = {Clustal Omega is a version, completely rewritten and revised in 2011, of the widely used Clustal series of programs for multiple sequence alignment. It can deal with very large numbers (many tens of thousands) of DNA/RNA or protein sequences due to its use of the mBed algorithm for calculating guide-trees. This algorithm allows very large alignment problems to be tackled very quickly, even on personal computers. The accuracy of the program has been considerably improved over earlier Clustal programs, through the use of the HHalign method for aligning profile hidden Markov models. The program currently is used from the command-line or can be run online.},
