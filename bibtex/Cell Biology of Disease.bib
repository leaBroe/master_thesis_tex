abstract = {Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1 (RCDP1) classic type, a peroxisome biogenesis disorder (PBD), is characterized by proximal shortening of the humerus and to a lesser degree the femur (rhizomelia), punctate calcifications in cartilage with epiphyseal and metaphyseal abnormalities (chondrodysplasia punctata, or CDP), coronal clefts of the vertebral bodies, and cataracts that are usually present at birth or appear in the first few months of life. Birth weight, length, and head circumference are often at the lower range of normal; postnatal growth deficiency is profound. Intellectual disability is severe, and the majority of children develop seizures. Most affected children do not survive the first decade of life; a proportion die in the neonatal period. A milder phenotype in which all affected individuals have congenital cataracts and chondrodysplasia is now recognized; some do not have rhizomelia, and some have less severe intellectual disability and growth deficiency. The diagnosis of RCDP1 is based on clinical findings and confirmed by biochemical or molecular genetic testing. Biochemical tests of peroxisome function include: red blood cell concentration of plasmalogens (deficient), plasma concentration of phytanic acid (elevated), and plasma concentration of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) (normal), which has consistently predicted the PEX7 receptor defect in RCDP1. PEX7, which encodes the receptor for a subset of peroxisomal matrix enzymes, is the only gene in which mutations are known to cause RCDP1. Treatment of manifestations: Management is supportive and limited by the multiple handicaps present at birth and poor outcome. Cataract extraction may restore some vision. Physical therapy is recommended to improve contractures; orthopedic procedures may improve function in some individuals. Prevention of primary manifestations: Dietary restriction of phytanic acid to avoid the consequences of phytanic acid accumulation over time may benefit individuals with milder forms of RCDP. Prevention of secondary manifestations: Poor feeding and recurrent aspiration may necessitate placement of a gastrostomy tube; attention to respiratory function with administration of influenza vaccine and RSV monoclonal antibody; docosohexanoic acid (DHA) supplementation in those who are deficient. Surveillance: Monitoring of growth and development and regular assessments for seizure control, vision, hearing, contractures, and orthopedic complications. RCDP1 is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of a proband has a 25{\%} chance of inheriting both mutant alleles and being affected, a 50{\%} chance of inheriting one mutant allele and being an unaffected carrier, and a 25{\%} chance of inheriting both normal alleles. Once the mutations have been identified in an affected family member, molecular genetic testing for carrier testing of at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible. Prenatal diagnosis by assay of plasmalogen biosynthesis is possible for pregnancies at 25{\%} risk for RCDP1.},

abstract = {Since the advent of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology a decade ago, enormous progress has been made in stem cell biology and regenerative medicine. Human iPSCs have been widely used for disease modelling, drug discovery and cell therapy development. Novel pathological mechanisms have been elucidated, new drugs originating from iPSC screens are in the pipeline and the first clinical trial using human iPSC-derived products has been initiated. In particular, the combination of human iPSC technology with recent developments in gene editing and 3D organoids makes iPSC-based platforms even more powerful in each area of their application, including precision medicine. In this Review, we discuss the progress in applications of iPSC technology that are particularly relevant to drug discovery and regenerative medicine, and consider the remaining challenges and the emerging opportunities in the field.},

abstract = {Adult Refsum disease is one of the few forms of tapetoretinal degenerations accessible for therapy. The disease is characterized by an elevated plasma phytanic acid level and high concentrations of phytanic acid in a variety tissues. Beside tapetoretinal degeneration, additional symptoms are chronic polyneuropathy, cerebellar ataxia, sensorineural hearing loss, anosmia, ichthyosis, skeletal malformations, and cardiac abnormalities. A diet low in phytanic acid leads to an amelioration of polyneuropathy and ataxia and slows or even stops the other manifestations. This beneficial effect of dietary precautions requires the need to get hold of as much patients as possible but better all of them. The ophthalmologist plays a crucial role to this end because of the early manifestation of the tapetoretinal degeneration. A delay of 11 years between the appearance of first symptoms and the diagnosis of Refsum disease, as reported in the literature, is not acceptable. {\textcopyright} Springer Medizin Verlag 2005.},

abstract = {Both the basal body and the microtubule-based axoneme it nucleates have evolutionarily conserved subdomains crucial for cilium biogenesis, function and maintenance. Here, we focus on two conspicuous but underappreciated regions of these structures that make membrane connections. One is the basal body distal end, which includes transition fibres of largely undefined composition that link to the base of the ciliary membrane. Transition fibres seem to serve as docking sites for intraflagellar transport particles, which move proteins within the ciliary compartment and are required for cilium biogenesis and sustained function. The other is the proximal-most region of the axoneme, termed the transition zone, which is characterized by Y-shaped linkers that span from the axoneme to the ciliary necklace on the membrane surface. The transition zone comprises a growing number of ciliopathy proteins that function as modular components of a ciliary gate. This gate, which forms early during ciliogenesis, might function in part by regulating intraflagellar transport. Together with a recently described septin ring diffusion barrier at the ciliary base, the transition fibres and transition zone deserve attention for their varied roles in forming functional ciliary compartments. {\textcopyright} 2012 European Molecular Biology Organization.},

abstract = {The green fluorescent protein (GFP) of the jellyfish Aequorea victoria is an unusual protein with strong visible absorbance and fluorescence from a p-hydroxybenzyli-dene-imidazolidinone chromophore, which is generated by cyclization and oxidation of the protein's own Ser-Tyr-Gly sequence at positions 65-67. Cloning of the cDNA and heter-ologous expression of fluorescent protein in a wide variety of organisms indicate that this unique posttranslational modification must be either spontaneous or dependent only on ubiquitous enzymes and reactants. We report that formation of the final fluorophore requires molecular oxygen and proceeds with a time constant (-4 hr at 22°C and atmospheric PO2) independent of dilution, implying that the oxidation does not require enzymes or cofactors. GFP was mutagenized and screened for variants with altered spectra. The most striking mutant fluoresced blue and contained histidine in place of Tyr-66. The availability of two visibly distinct colors should significantly extend the usefulness of GFP in molecular and cell biology by enabling in vivo visualization of differential gene expression and protein localization and measurement of protein association by fluorescence resonance energy transfer.},

From the analysis of the mutational burden in patients to the functional characterization of the BBS proteins, this syndrome has become a model for both understanding oligogenic patterns of inheritance and the biology of a particular cellular organelle: the primary cilium. Here we briefly review the genetics of BBS to then focus on the function of the BBS proteins, not only in the context of the cilium but also highlighting potential extra-ciliary roles that could be relevant to the etiology of the disorder. Finally, we provide an overview of how the study of this rare syndrome has contributed to the understanding of cilia biology and how this knowledge has informed on the cellular basis of different clinical manifestations that characterize BBS and the ciliopathies.},

abstract = {Parkinson disease (PD) is characterized by loss of the A9 nigral neurons that provide dopaminergic innervation to the striatum. This discovery led to the successful instigation of dopaminergic drug treatments in the 1960s, although these drugs were soon recognized to lose some of their efficacy and generate their own adverse effects over time. Despite the fact that PD is now known to have extensive non-nigral pathology with a wide range of clinical features, dopaminergic drug therapies are still the mainstay of therapy, and work well for many years. Given the success of pharmacological dopamine replacement, pursuit of cell-based dopamine replacement strategies seemed to be the next logical step, and studies were initiated over 30 years ago to explore the possibility of dopaminergic cell transplantation. In this Review, we outline the history of this therapeutic approach to PD and highlight the lessons that we have learned en route. We discuss how the best clinical outcomes have been obtained with fetal ventral mesencephalic allografts, while acknowledging inconsistencies in the results owing to problems in trial design, patient selection, tissue preparation, and immunotherapy used post-grafting. We conclude by discussing the challenges of bringing the new generation of stem cell-derived dopamine cells to the clinic.},

abstract = {Background: Peroxisomes are organelles that proliferate continuously and play an indispensable role in human metabolism. Consequently, peroxisomal gene defects can cause multiple, often severe disorders, including the peroxisome biogenesis disorders. Currently, 13 different PEX proteins have been implicated in various stages of peroxisome assembly and protein import. Defects in any of these proteins result in a peroxisome biogenesis disorder. The authors present here a novel genetic defect specifically affecting the division of peroxisomes. Methods: The authors have studied biochemical and microscopical peroxisomal parameters in cultured patient fibroblasts, sequenced candidate PEX genes and determined the consequence of the identified PEX11$\beta$ gene defect on peroxisome biogenesis in patient fibroblasts at different temperatures. Results: The patient presented with congenital cataracts, mild intellectual disability, progressive hearing loss, sensory nerve involvement, gastrointestinal problems and recurrent migraine-like episodes. Although microscopical investigations of patient fibroblasts indicated a clear defect in peroxisome division, all biochemical parameters commonly used for diagnosing peroxisomal disorders were normal. After excluding mutations in all PEX genes previously implicated in peroxisome biogenesis disorders, it was found that the defect was caused by a homozygous non-sense mutation in the PEX11$\beta$ gene. The peroxisome division defect was exacerbated when the patient's fibroblasts were cultured at 40 C, which correlated with a marked decrease in the expression of PEX11$\gamma$. Conclusions: This novel isolated defect in peroxisome division expands the clinical and genetic spectrum of peroxisomal disorders and indicates that peroxisomal defects exist, which cannot be diagnosed by standard laboratory investigations.},

abstract = {Human peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive disorders comprised of two clinically distinct subtypes: the Zellweger syndrome spectrum (ZSS) disorders and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP) type 1. PBDs are caused by defects in any of at least 14 different PEX genes, which encode proteins involved in peroxisome assembly and proliferation. Thirteen of these genes are associated with ZSS disorders. The genetic heterogeneity among PBDs and the inability to predict from the biochemical and clinical phenotype of a patient with ZSS which of the currently known 13 PEX genes is defective, has fostered the development of different strategies to identify the causative gene defects. These include PEX cDNA transfection complementation assays followed by sequencing of the thus identified PEX genes, and a PEX gene screen in which the most frequently mutated exons of the different PEX genes are analyzed. The benefits of DNA testing for PBDs include carrier testing of relatives, early prenatal testing or preimplantation genetic diagnosis in families with a recurrence risk for ZSS disorders, and insight in genotype-phenotype correlations, which may eventually assist to improve patient management. In this review we describe the current status of genetic analysis and the molecular basis of PBDs.

abstract = {The lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a group of inherited metabolic disorders caused by the deficiency of any of the lysosomal functions, in most cases of lysosomal hydrolases. LSDs are typically characterized by storage of a variety of substrates in multiple tissues and organs and by the variable association of unusual clinical manifestations that are often responsible for physical and neurological handicaps. During the past two decades, research in the field of LSDs has made marked progress, particularly with the development of a variety of innovative therapeutic approaches. These include several strategies aimed at increasing the residual activity of the missing enzyme, such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, enzyme replacement therapy, pharmacological chaperone therapy and gene therapy. An alternative approach is based on reducing the synthesis of the stored substrate. More recently, the improved knowledge on LSD pathophysiology has indicated additional targets of therapy. The recent progress made in the treatment of LSDs represents a good model that may be extended to other genetic disorders.},
