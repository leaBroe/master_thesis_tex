abstract = {The Rho subgroup of the Rho GTPases consisting of RhoA, RhoB and RhoC induces a specific type of actin cytoskeleton and carry out a variety of functions in the cell. mDia and ROCK are downstream effectors of Rho mediating Rho action on the actin cytoskeleton; mDia produces actin filaments by nucleation and polymerization and ROCK activate myosin to cross-link them for induction of actomyosin bundles and contractility. mDia is potentially linked to Rac activation and membrane ruffle formation through c-Src-induced phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins, and ROCK antagonizes this mDia action. Thus, cell morphogenesis, adhesion, and motility can be determined by the balance between mDia and ROCK activities. Though they are not oncogenes by themselves, overexpression of RhoA and RhoC are often found in clinical cancers, and RhoC has been repeatedly identified as a gene associated with metastasis. The Rho-ROCK pathway is implicated in Ras-mediated transformation, the amoeboid movement of tumor cells in the three-dimensional matrix, and transmigration of tumor cells through the mesothelial monolayer. On the other hand, the Rho-mDia1 pathway is implicated in Src-mediated remodeling of focal adhesions and migration of tumor cells. There is also an indication that the Rho pathway other than ROCK is involved in Src-mediated induction of podosome and regulation of matrix metalloproteases. Thus, Rho mediates various phenotypes of malignant transformation by Ras and Src through its effectors, ROCK and mDia.},

abstract = {Cell adhesion is essential in cell communication and regulation, and is of fundamental importance in the development and maintenance of tissues. The mechanical interactions between a cell and its extracellular matrix (ECM) can influence and control cell behavior and function. The essential function of cell adhesion has created tremendous interests in developing methods for measuring and studying cell adhesion properties. The study of cell adhesion could be categorized into cell adhesion attachment and detachment events. The study of cell adhesion has been widely explored via both events for many important purposes in cellular biology, biomedical, and engineering fields. Cell adhesion attachment and detachment events could be further grouped into the cell population and single cell approach. Various techniques to measure cell adhesion have been applied to many fields of study in order to gain understanding of cell signaling pathways, biomaterial studies for implantable sensors, artificial bone and tooth replacement, the development of tissue-on-a-chip and organ-on-a-chip in tissue engineering, the effects of biochemical treatments and environmental stimuli to the cell adhesion, the potential of drug treatments, cancer metastasis study, and the determination of the adhesion properties of normal and cancerous cells. This review discussed the overview of the available methods to study cell adhesion through attachment and detachment events.},

abstract = {Myeloid cells form a first line of defense against infections. They migrate from the circulation to the infected tissues by adhering to and subsequently crossing the vascular wall. This process requires precise control and proper regulation of these interactions with the environment is therefore crucial. Podosomes are the most prominent adhesion structures in myeloid cells. Podosomes control both the adhesive and migratory properties of myeloid cells and the regulation of podosomes is key to the proper functioning of these cells. Here we discuss the regulation of podosomes by Rho GTPases, well known regulators of adhesion and migration, focusing on myeloid cells. In addition, the regulation of podosomes by GTPase regulators such as GEFs and GAPs, as well as the effects of some Rho GTPase effector pathways, will be discussed. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier GmbH.},

@article{Gong2023,
abstract = {Immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, can utilize podosomes, mechanosensitive actin-rich protrusions, to generate forces, migrate, and patrol for foreign antigens. Individual podosomes probe their microenvironment through periodic protrusion and retraction cycles (height oscillations), while oscillations of multiple podosomes in a cluster are coordinated in a wave-like fashion. However, the mechanisms governing both the individual oscillations and the collective wave-like dynamics remain unclear. Here, by integrating actin polymerization, myosin contractility, actin diffusion, and mechanosensitive signaling, we develop a chemo-mechanical model for podosome dynamics in clusters. Our model reveals that podosomes show oscillatory growth when actin polymerization-driven protrusion and signaling-associated myosin contraction occur at similar rates, while the diffusion of actin monomers drives wave-like coordination of podosome oscillations. Our theoretical predictions are validated by different pharmacological treatments and the impact of microenvironment stiffness on chemo-mechanical waves. Our proposed framework can shed light on the role of podosomes in immune cell mechanosensing within the context of wound healing and cancer immunotherapy.},

abstract = {Increasing experimental evidence points to the physiological importance of space–time correlations in signaling of cell collectives. From wound healing to epithelial homeostasis to morphogenesis, coordinated activation of biomolecules between cells allows the collectives to perform more complex tasks and to better tackle environmental challenges. To capture this information exchange and to advance new theories of emergent phenomena, we created ARCOS, a computational method to detect and quantify collective signaling. We demonstrate ARCOS on cell and organism collectives with space–time correlations on different scales in 2D and 3D. We made a new observation that oncogenic mutations in the MAPK/ERK and PIK3CA/Akt pathways of MCF10A epithelial cells hyperstimulate intercellular ERK activity waves that are largely dependent on matrix metalloproteinase intercellular signaling. ARCOS is open-source and available as R and Python packages. It also includes a plugin for the napari image viewer to interactively quantify collective phenomena without prior programming experience.},

@article{Mahlandt2021,
abstract = {Rho GTPases are regulatory proteins, which orchestrate cell features such as morphology, polarity and movement. Therefore, probing Rho GTPase activity is key to understanding processes such as development and cell migration. Localization-based reporters for active Rho GTPases are attractive probes to study Rho GTPase-mediated processes in real time with subcellular resolution in living cells and tissue. Until now, relocation Rho biosensors (sensors that relocalize to the native location of active Rho GTPase) seem to have been only useful in certain organisms and have not been characterized well. In this paper, we systematically examined the contribution of the fluorescent protein and Rho-binding peptides on the performance of localization-based sensors. To test the performance, we compared relocation efficiency and specificity in cell-based assays. We identified several improved localization-based, genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors for detecting endogenous Rho activity. This enables a broader application of Rho relocation biosensors, which was demonstrated by using the improved biosensor to visualize Rho activity during several cellular processes, such as cell division, migration and G protein-coupled receptor signaling. Owing to the improved avidity of the new biosensors for Rho activity, cellular processes regulated by Rho can be better understood.},
