abstract = {The peptidoglycan of the bacterial cell wall undergoes a permanent turnover during cell growth and differentiation. In the Gram-positive pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, the major peptidoglycan hydrolase Atl is required for accurate cell division, daughter cell separation and autolysis. Atl is a bifunctional N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase/endo-$\beta$-N-acetylglucosaminidase that releases peptides and the disaccharide N-acetylmuramic acid-$\beta$-1,4-N-acetylglucosamine (MurNAc-GlcNAc) from the peptido-glycan. Here we revealed the recycling pathway of the cell wall turnover product MurNAc-GlcNAc in S. aureus. The latter disaccharide is internalized and concomitantly phosphorylated by the phosphotransferase system (PTS) transporter MurP, which had been implicated previously in the uptake and phosphorylation of MurNAc. Since MurP mutant cells accumulate MurNAc-GlcNAc and not MurNAc in the culture medium during growth, the disaccharide represents the physiological substrate of the PTS transporter. We further identified and characterized a novel 6-phospho-N-acetylmuramidase, named MupG, which intracellularly hydrolyses MurNAc 6-phosphate-GlcNAc, the product of MurP-uptake and phosphorylation, yielding MurNAc 6-phosphate and GlcNAc. MupG is the first characterized representative of a novel family of glycosidases containing domain of unknown function 871 (DUF871). The corresponding gene mupG (SAUSA300-0192) of S. aureus strain USA300 is the first gene within a putative operon that also includes genes encoding the MurNAc 6-phosphate etherase MurQ, MurP, and the putative transcriptional regulator MurR. Using mass spectrometry, we observed cytoplasmic accumulation of MurNAc 6-phosphate-GlcNAc in $\Delta$mupG and $\Delta$mupGmurQ markerless non-polar deletion mutants, but not in the wild type or in the complemented $\Delta$mupG strain. MurNAc 6-phosphate-GlcNAc levels in the mutants increased during stationary phase, in accordance with previous observations regarding peptidoglycan recycling in S. aureus.},

abstract = {Helicobacter species are Gram-negative bacteria that colonize the gastric or intestinal mucosa of many mammalian and avian hosts and induce histologic inflammation. The association of H. pylori with gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and gastric cancers makes it a significant human pathogen. Animal models for these diseases are being used to explore the pathogenesis of H. pylori infection and in vaccine development (UNIT 8B.1). Both bacterial and host factors contribute to Helicobacter pathogenesis, and therefore the microbiology is very important. This unit describes how to culture the most commonly used gastric Helicobacter species, H. pylori, H. mustelae, and H. felis. In vitro, Helicobacter species grow quite slowly and only under conditions of reduced (but not absent) oxygen (i.e., microaerophilic conditions) and rich media. Primary cultures may take up to 5 to 7 days to achieve optimal growth, although subsequent passages take only a few days. Identification of H. pylori can be made by confirming the presence of urease, catalase, and oxidase enzymes, and by observing microscopic evidence of high motility and a spiral or curved morphology (Windsor and O'Rourke, 2000). Colonies are small and round, and appear translucent against the blood agar background. H. pylori is resistant to sulfonamides, vancomycin, trimethoprim, and cefsulodin, which allows for the creation of a very effective selective media when isolating bacteria from clinical biopsies. It is sensitive, however, to many common antibiotics including tetracycline, gentamicin, kanamycin, and Internet Resources Web sites for detailed information about H. pylori history, epidemiology, and pathogenesis.},

abstract = {Energy coupling factor (ECF) transporters are a subgroup of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters involved in the uptake of vitamins and micronutrients in prokaryotes. In contrast to classical ABC importers, ECF transporters do not make use of water-soluble substrate binding proteins or domains but instead employ integral membrane proteins for substrate binding (named S-components). S-components form active translocation complexes with the ECF module, an assembly of two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs, or EcfA) and a second transmembrane protein. In some cases, the ECF module is dedicated to a single S-component, but in many cases, the ECF module can interact with several different S-components that are unrelated in sequence and bind diverse substrates. The modular organization with exchangeable S-components on a single ECF module allows the transport of chemically different substrates via a common route. The recent determination of the crystal structures of the S-components that recognize thiamin and riboflavin has provided a first clue about the mechanism of S-component exchange. This review describes recent advances and the current views of the mechanism of transport by ECF transporters. (Figure Presented). {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {A key challenge in microbiome research is to predict functionality from microbial community composition. As central microbiota functions are determined by bacterial community networks it is important to gain insight into the principles that govern bacteria-bacteria interactions. Here, we focused on growth and metabolic interactions of the Oligo-Mouse-Microbiota (OMM12) synthetic bacterial community, which is increasingly used as model system in gut microbiome research. Using a bottom-up approach, we uncovered the directionality of strain-strain interactions in mono- and pairwise co-culture experiments, as well as in community batch culture. Metabolomics analysis of spent culture supernatant of individual strains in combination with genome-informed pathway reconstruction provided insights into the metabolic potential of the individual community members. Thereby, we could show that the OMM12 interaction network is shaped by both, exploitative and interference competition in vitro. In particular, Enterococcus faecalis KB1 was identified as important driver of community composition by affecting the abundance of several other consortium members. Together, this study gives fundamental insight into key drivers and mechanistic basis of the OMM12 interaction network, which serves as knowledge base for future mechanistic studies. {\#}{\#}{\#} Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {Helicobacter pylori is a major human pathogen for which increasing antibiotic resistance constitutes a serious threat to human health. Molecular mechanisms underlying this resistance have been intensively studied and are discussed in this Review. Three profiles of resistance — single drug resistance, multidrug resistance and heteroresistance — seem to occur, probably with overlapping fundamental mechanisms and clinical implications. The mechanisms that have been most studied are related to mutational changes encoded chromosomally and disrupt the cellular activity of antibiotics through target-mediated mechanisms. Other biological attributes driving drug resistance in H. pylori have been less explored and this could imply more complex physiological changes (such as impaired regulation of drug uptake and/or efflux, or biofilm and coccoid formation) that remain largely elusive. Resistance-related attributes deployed by the pathogen cause treatment failures, diagnostic difficulties and ambiguity in clinical interpretation of therapeutic outcomes. Subsequent to the increasing antibiotic resistance, a substantial drop in H. pylori treatment efficacy has been noted globally. In the absence of an efficient vaccine, enhanced efforts are needed for setting new treatment strategies and for a better understanding of the emergence and spread of drug-resistant bacteria, as well as for improving diagnostic tools that can help optimize current antimicrobial regimens.},

Various techniques, such as the resazurin-reduction assays, the mycobacterial growth indicator tube or polymerase chain reaction-based methods, have been used to investigate bacterial metabolism and its response to drugs. However, many are relatively expensive or unable to distinguish between living and dead bacteria. Here we show that the fluctuations of highly sensitive atomic force microscope cantilevers can be used to detect low concentrations of bacteria, characterize their metabolism and quantitatively screen (within minutes) their response to antibiotics. We applied this methodology to Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, showing that live bacteria produced larger cantilever fluctuations than bacteria exposed to antibiotics. Our preliminary experiments suggest that the fluctuation is associated with bacterial metabolism. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Benzoxazinoids, comprising the classes of benzoxazinones and benzoxazolinones, are a set of specialised metabolites produced by the plant family Poaceae (formerly Gramineae), and some dicots. The family Poaceae in particular contains several important crops like maize and wheat. Benzoxazinoids play a role in allelopathy and as defence compounds against (micro)biological threats. The effectivity of benzoxazinones in these functionalities is largely imposed by the subclasses (determined by N substituent). In this review, we provide an overview of all currently known natural benzoxazinoids and a summary of the current state of knowledge of their biosynthesis. We also evaluated their antimicrobial activity based on minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values reported in literature. Monomeric natural benzoxazinoids seem to lack potency as antimicrobial agents. The 1,4-benzoxazin-3-one backbone, however, has been shown to be a potential scaffold for designing new antimicrobial compounds. This has been demonstrated by a number of studies that report potent activity of synthetic derivatives of 1,4-benzoxazin-3-one, which possess MIC values down to 6.25 $\mu$g mL−1 against pathogenic fungi (e.g. C. albicans) and 16 $\mu$g mL−1 against bacteria (e.g. S. aureus and E. coli). Observations on the structural requirements for allelopathy, insecticidal, and antimicrobial activity suggest that they are not necessarily conferred by similar mechanisms.},

abstract = {Benzoxazinoids, secondary metabolites of several Poaceae, and some benzoxazinoid downstream metabolites are bioactive compounds that act as allelochemicals and natural pesticides. Since a short lifetime of the substances is crucial to avoid long-term environmental effects, total degradation by microorganisms is of exceptional importance. We performed a screening with cultivable microorganisms (Species names and strain numbers: Mycobacterium fortuitum, 7; Bacillus aryabhattai, 34; Bacillus cereus, 59; Bacillus megaterium, 21, 48; Bacillus methylotrophicus, 58; Lysinibacillus xylanilyticus, 56; Paenibacillus polymyxa, 51; Aminobacter aminovorans, 49; the fungi Papulaspora sepedonioides, 12 and Trichoderma viride, 47) isolated from soil previously used for wheat and Persian clover mixed-culture systems to assess their behavior in the presence of the compounds. The microorganisms were exposed to glucosylated benzoxazinones, the benzoxazinones HBOA, DIBOA, and DIMBOA, the benzoxazolinones BOA, BOA-6-OH, and MBOA, and to several downstream products (AP, AAP, oHPMA, glucoside carbamate) in liquid culture to avoid interferences with soil minerals and other organisms. The microorganisms differed strongly in their metabolic activities in terms of growth, compound modification, and degradation. We observed degradation with DIBOA and GDIMBOA but rarely with DIMBOA, whereas BOA and MBOA showed almost no degradation when directly applied. Hydroxylation of BOA and demethylation of MBOA by the plant, resulting in BOA-6-OH, activated the benzoxazolinones for bacterial nitration. The resulting NBOA-6-OH was short-lived but could function temporarily as an allelochemical by inhibiting photosynthesis, e.g., in young seedlings of cress and kohlrabi. The BOA downstream products AP and oHPMA were converted to AAP, which can be nitrated to N-(2-OH-5-nitrophenyl)-acetamide and then degraded by A. aminovorans (49) and P. polymyxa (51). Only P. sepedonioides (12) and P. polymyxa (51) failed in the conversion of HBOA into AAP. While DIBOA, DIMBOA, MBOA, NBOA-6-OH, AP, AAP, and oHPMA reduced the growth of most microorganisms, glucoside carbamate promoted their growth. GDIMBOA had a stimulatory effect toward the fungi and three bacterial species. These findings lead to the hypothesis that in a natural habitat, such as the root surface, microorganisms may cooperate, perhaps by involving the plant, for the successful elimination of benzoxazinoids and their downstream metabolites.},

abstract = {Aim To determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of commonly used antibiotics against Helicobacter Pylori (H. pylori) in South China and compare their resistance rates by using EUCAST breakpoints and other breakpoints. Methods Patients who had not previously received H. pylori treatment in clinical centers in South China were enrolled in this study from 2017 to 2020. Gastric biopsies were obtained for H. pylori culture. The MICs of amoxicillin (AMX), clarithromycin (CLA), metronidazole (MTZ), levofloxacin (LEV), tetracycline (TET) and furazolidone (FZD) were tested by broth microdilution method and assessed by two different breakpoints. ATCC43504 standard strain served as a control. Results A total of 208 H. pylori strains were isolated from patients' biopsy samples. The MICs of AMX, CLA, MTZ, LEV, TET and FZD for H. pylori were 0.0156-256mg/L (MIC50 0.125mg/L, MIC90 4mg/L), 0.0156- {\textgreater}256 mg/L (MIC50 0.0312mg/L, MIC90 64mg/L), 0.0156- {\textgreater}256mg/L (MIC50 8mg/L, MIC90 256mg/L), 0.0156-256mg/L (MIC50 0.25mg/L, MIC90 16mg/L), 0.0156-256mg/L (MIC50 0.0625mg/L, MIC90 4mg/L), and 0.0156- {\textgreater}256mg/L (MIC50 0.0312mg/L, MIC90 2mg/L), respectively. The MICs of AMX, CLA, MTZ, LEV, TET and FZD for ATCC43504 strain were 0.25mg/L, 0.0625mg/L, 64mg/L, 0.5mg/L, 1mg/L and 0.25mg/L, respectively. The resistance rate of FZD was 11.05{\%}. The overall resistance rates according to EUCAST breakpoints and other breakpoints were 57.21{\%} and 14.90{\%} for AMX (p{\textless}0.001), 38.94{\%} and 38.94{\%} for CLA (p = 1), 39.42{\%} and 50.96{\%} for MTZ (p{\textless}0.001), 12.98{\%} and 10.58{\%} for TET (p = 0.025), 35.10{\%} and 35.10{\%} for LEV (p = 1), respectively. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that AMX, FZD, and TET, but not MTZ, CLR or LEV, showed good anti-H. pylori activity in vitro in South China. When different breakpoints were used, similar results were found with CLA, and LEV, but not with AMX, MTZ, or TET.},

abstract = {More than 20 carbohydrates may be transported into the bacterial cell by the phosphoenopyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) that is widely spread among bacteria. The PTS consists of two cytoplasmic energy-coupling proteins (Enzyme I and HPr) and a range of carbohydrate-specific Enzymes II, which catalyze concomitant carbohydrate translocation and phosphorylation. The phosphorylation status of PTS components reflects the availability of carbohydrates and the energy conditions of the cell. In many bacteria, PTS and the associated proteins convert this information to signals, which transduced through different mechanisms lead to phenomena of catabolite repression, inducer control or chemotaxis. These features of PTS provide bacteria with an integrated system, which assures optimal utilization of carbohydrates in complex environments. Furthemore, some bacteria evolved parallel systems that serve a regulatory functions, but apparently do not catalyze the carbohydrate transport. Here we review the findings that recently advanced the understanding of various aspects of PTS-dependent carbohydrate transport and regulation of bacterial catabolism.},

abstract = {The chb operon of Escherichia coli is involved in the utilization of the $\beta$-glucosides chitobiose and cellobiose. The function of chbG (ydjC), the sixth open reading frame of the operon that codes for an evolutionarily conserved protein is unknown. We show that chbG encodes a monodeacetylase that is essential for growth on the acetylated chitooligosaccharides chitobiose and chitotriose but is dispensable for growth on cellobiose and chitosan dimer, the deacetylated form of chitobiose. The predicted active site of the enzyme was validated by demonstrating loss of function upon substitution of its putative metal-binding residues that are conserved across the YdjC family of proteins. We show that activation of the chb promoter by the regulatory protein ChbR is dependent on ChbG, suggesting that deacetylation of chitobiose-6-P and chitotriose-6-P is necessary for their recognition by ChbR as inducers. Strains carrying mutations in chbR conferring the ability to grow on both cellobiose and chitobiose are independent of chbG function for induction, suggesting that gain of function mutations in ChbR allow it to recognize the acetylated form of the oligosaccharides. ChbR-independent expression of the permease and phospho-$\beta$-glucosidase from a heterologous promoter did not support growth on both chitobiose and chitotriose in the absence of chbG, suggesting an additional role of chbG in the hydrolysis of chitooligosaccharides. The homologs of chbG in metazoans have been implicated in development and inflammatory diseases of the intestine, indicating that understanding the function of E. coli chbG has a broader significance. {\textcopyright} 2012, American Society for Microbiology.},

A number of bacteria produce urease (ureolytic bacteria) and are associated with various infectious diseases and ammonia emissions from agriculture. We report the first comprehensive comparison of the inhibition of urease activity by compounds analysed under the same conditions. Thus, 71 commercially available compounds were screened for their anti-ureolytic properties against both the ureolytic bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae and purified jack bean urease. Of the tested compounds, 30 showed more than 25{\%} inhibition of the ureolytic activity of Klebsiella pneumoniae or jack bean urease, and among these, carbon disulfide, N-phenylmaleimide, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, sodium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate, 1,2,4-butanetricarboxylic acid, tannic acid, and gallic acid have not previously been reported to possess anti-ureolytic properties. The diverse effects of metal ion chelators on ureolysis were investigated using a cellular nickel uptake assay. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and dimethylglyoxime (DMG) clearly reduced the nickel import and ureolytic activity of cells, oxalic acid stimulated nickel import but reduced the ureolytic activity of cells, 1,2,4-butanetricarboxylic acid strongly stimulated nickel import and slightly increased the ureolytic activity of cells, while L-cysteine had no effect on nickel import but efficiently reduced the ureolytic activity of cells.},

abstract = {Purpose of review Treatment of Helicobacter pylori is difficult nowadays because of its high resistance. The prevalence and mechanism of resistance, the different methods to detect it and the clinical implication of resistance were addressed in several research papers last year. Recent findings Clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori has been recognized by the WHO as 'high priority', for which new antibiotics are needed. Moreover, the Maastricht consensus recommended, in areas with high resistance, that susceptibility tests should be performed, at least after a treatment failure. Summary Metronidazole and clarithromycin resistance rates are alarming although they vary among populations. Tetracycline and amoxicillin-resistance are very low in most countries. H. pylori resistance can be detected by phenotypic or by molecular methods. Different break points may be used when performing an antimicrobial susceptibility test, so comparing resistance among different populations is challenging. Genomic techniques open new possibilities in the diagnosis of H. pylori, and the detection of H. pylori and its antimicrobial resistance in faeces is an interesting approach. Eradication rates are dependent on the susceptibility of the strain to metronidazole and clarithromycin, being lower in patients infected with a resistant strain.},

Specifically, we describe a platform that can be applied to the preparation of medium that mimics lung and wound exudate or blood conditions for the growth and susceptibility testing of bacteria, including ESKAPE pathogens. This protocol can also be applied to most physiologically relevant liquid medium and aerobic pathogens, and takes 3–4 d to complete.

The standard triple therapy consists of a proton pump inhibitor, amoxicillin and clarithromycin, although many other regimens are used, including quadruple, sequential and concomitant therapy regimens supplemented with metronidazole, clarithromycin and levofloxacin. Despite these efforts, current therapeutic regimens lack efficacy in eradication due to antibiotic resistance, drug compliance and antibiotic degradation by the acidic stomach environment. Antibiotic resistance to clarithromycin and metronidazole is particularly problematic and several approaches have been proposed to overcome this issue, such as complementary probiotic therapy with Lactobacillus. Other studies have identified novel molecules with an anti-H. pylori effect, as well as tailored therapy and nanotechnology as viable alternative eradication strategies. This review discusses current antibiotic therapy for H. pylori infections, limitations of this type of therapy and predicts the availability of newly developed therapies for H. pylori eradication.},

abstract = {Holins form pores in the cytoplasmic membranes of bacteria for the primary purpose of releasing endolysins that hydrolyze the cell wall and induce cell death. Holins are encoded within bacteriophage genomes, where they promote cell lysis for virion release, and within bacterial genomes, where they serve a diversity of potential or established functions. These include (i) release of gene transfer agents, (ii) facilitation of programs of differentiation such as those that allow sporulation and spore germination, (iii) contribution to biofilm formation, (iv) promotion of responses to stress conditions, and (v) release of toxins and other proteins. There are currently 58 recognized families of holins and putative holins with members exhibiting between 1 and 4 transmembrane ±-helical spanners, but many more families have yet to be discovered. Programmed cell death in animals involves holin-like proteins such as Bax and Bak that may have evolved from bacterial holins. Holin homologues have also been identified in archaea, suggesting that these proteins are ubiquitous throughout the three domains of life. Phage-mediated cell lysis of dualmembrane Gram-negative bacteria also depends on outer membrane-disrupting "spanins" that function independently of, but in conjunction with, holins and endolysins. In this minireview, we provide an overview of their modes of action and the first comprehensive summary of the many currently recognized and postulated functions and uses of these cell lysis systems. It is anticipated that future studies will result in the elucidation of many more such functions and the development of additional applications.},

abstract = {In this paper, we evaluated the anti-Helicobacter pylori activity and the possible inhibitory effect on its associated urease by Palmatine (Pal) from Coptis chinensis, and explored the potential underlying mechanism. Results indicated that Pal exerted inhibitory effect on four tested H. pylori strains (ATCC 43504, NCTC 26695, SS1 and ICDC 111001) by the agar dilution test with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 100 to 200 $\mu$g/mL under neutral environment (pH 7.4), and from 75 to 100 $\mu$g/mL under acidic conditions (pH 5.3), respectively. Pal was observed to significantly inhibit both H. pylori urease (HPU) and jack bean urease (JBU) in a dose-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 0.53 ± 0.01 mM and 0.03 ± 0.00 mM, respectively, as compared with acetohydroxamic acid, a well-known urease inhibitor (0.07 ± 0.01 mM for HPU and 0.02 ± 0.00 mM for JBU, respectively). Kinetic analyses showed that the type of urease inhibition by Pal was noncompetitive for both HPU and JBU. Higher effectiveness of thiol protectors against urease inhibition than the competitive Ni2+ binding inhibitors was observed, indicating the essential role of the active-site sulfhydryl group in the urease inhibition by Pal. DTT reactivation assay indicated that the inhibition on the two ureases was reversible, further supporting that sulfhydryl group should be obligatory for urease inhibition by Pal. Furthermore, molecular docking study indicated that Pal interacted with the important sulfhydryl groups and inhibited the active enzymatic conformation through N-H{\textperiodcentered}$\pi$ interaction, but did not interact with the active site Ni2+. Taken together, Pal was an effective inhibitor of H. pylori and its urease targeting the sulfhydryl groups, representing a promising candidate as novel urease inhibitor.

abstract = {The Oligo-Mouse-Microbiota (OMM12) is a recently developed synthetic bacterial community for functional microbiome research in mouse models (Brugiroux et al., 2016). To date, the OMM12 model has been established in several germ-free mouse facilities world-wide and is employed to address a growing variety of research questions related to infection biology, mucosal immunology, microbial ecology and host-microbiome metabolic cross-talk. The OMM12 consists of 12 sequenced and publically available strains isolated from mice, representing five bacterial phyla that are naturally abundant in the murine gastrointestinal tract (Lagkouvardos et al., 2016). Under germ-free conditions, the OMM12 colonizes mice stably over multiple generations. Here, we investigated whether stably colonized OMM12 mouse lines could be reproducibly established in different animal facilities. Germ-free C57Bl/6J mice were inoculated with a frozen mixture of the OMM12 strains. Within 2 weeks after application, the OMM12 community reached the same stable composition in all facilities, as determined by fecal microbiome analysis. We show that a second application of the OMM12 strains after 72 h leads to a more stable community composition than a single application. The availability of such protocols for reliable de novo generation of gnotobiotic rodents will certainly contribute to increasing experimental reproducibility in biomedical research.},

abstract = {Antibiotic resistance in Helicobacter pylori has been growing worldwide with current treatment regimens. Development of new compounds for treatment of H. pylori infections is urgently required to achieve a successful eradication therapy in the future. Armeniaspirols, a novel class of natural products isolated from Streptomyces armeniacus, have been previously identified as antibacterial agents against Gram-positive pathogens. In this study, we found that armeniaspirol A (ARM1) exhibited potent antibacterial activity against H. pylori, including multidrug-resistant strains, with MIC range values of 4–16 $\mu$g ml-1. The underlying mechanism of action of ARM1 against H. pylori involved the disruption of bacterial cell membranes. Also, ARM1 inhibited biofilm formation, eliminated preformed biofilms and killed biofilm-encased H. pylori in a dose-dependent manner. In a mouse model of multidrug-resistant H. pylori infection, dual therapy with ARM1 and omeprazole showed efficient in vivo killing efficacy comparable to the standard triple therapy, and induced negligible toxicity against normal tissues. Moreover, at acidic pH 2.5, ARM1 exhibited a much more potent anti-H. pylori activity than metronidazole. Thus, these findings demonstrated that ARM1 is a novel potent anti-H. pylori agent, which can be developed as a promising drug lead for treatment of H. pylori infections.},

abstract = {Ureases are enzymes from plants, fungi and bacteria that catalyze the hydrolysis of urea to form ammonia and carbon dioxide. While fungal and plant ureases are homo-oligomers of 90-kDa subunits, bacterial ureases are multimers of two or three subunit complexes. We showed that some isoforms of jack bean urease, canatoxin and the classical urease, bind to glycoconjugates and induce platelet aggregation. Canatoxin also promotes release of histamine from mast cells, insulin from pancreatic cells and neurotransmitters from brain synaptosomes. In vivo it induces rat paw edema and neutrophil chemotaxis. These effects are independent of ureolytic activity and require activation of eicosanoid metabolism and calcium channels. Helicobacter pylori, a Gram-negative bacterium that colonizes the human stomach mucosa, causes gastric ulcers and cancer by a mechanism that is not understood. H. pylori produces factors that damage gastric epithelial cells, such as the vacuolating cytotoxin VacA, the cytotoxin-associated protein CagA, and a urease (up to 10{\%} of bacterial protein) that neutralizes the acidic medium permitting its survival in the stomach. H. pylori whole cells or extracts of its water-soluble proteins promote inflammation, activate neutrophils and induce the release of cytokines. In this paper we review data from the literature suggesting that H. pylori urease displays many of the biological activities observed for jack bean ureases and show that bacterial ureases have a secretagogue effect modulated by eicosanoid metabolites through lipoxygenase pathways. These findings could be relevant to the elucidation of the role of urease in the pathogenesis of the gastrointestinal disease caused by H. pylori.},

In this study, we identified and characterized a heavy metal-associated protein, AcHMA1, from the halophyte, Atriplex canescens. Sequence analysis has revealed that AcHMA1 contains two heavy metal binding domains. Treatments with metals (Fe, Cu, Ni, Cd or Pb), PEG6000 and NaHCO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} highly induced AcHMA1 expression in A. canescens, whereas NaCl and low temperature decreased its expression. The role of AcHMA1 in metal stress tolerance was examined using a yeast expression system. Expression of the AcHMA1 gene significantly increased the ability of yeast cells to adapt to and recover from exposure to excess iron. AcHMA1 expression also provided salt, alkaline, osmotic and oxidant stress tolerance in yeast cells. Finally, subcellular localization of an AcHMA1/GFP fusion protein expressed in tobacco cells showed that AcHMA1 was localized in the plasma membrane. Thus, our results suggest that AcHMA1 encodes a membrane-localized metal tolerance protein that mediates the detoxification of iron in eukaryotes. Furthermore, AcHMA1 also participates in the response to abiotic stress. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

MICs are used by diagnostic laboratories mainly to confirm resistance, but most often as a research tool to determine the in vitro activity of new antimicrobials, and data from such studies have been used to determine MIC breakpoints. MBC determinations are undertaken less frequently and their major use has been reserved for isolates from the blood of patients with endocarditis. Standardized methods for determining MICs and MBCs are described in this paper. Like all standardized procedures, the method must be adhered to and may not be adapted by the user.

abstract = {The SmtB/ArsR family of prokaryotic metalloregulatory transcriptional repressors represses the expression of operons linked to stress-inducing concentrations of di- and multivalent heavy metal ions. Derepression results from direct binding of metal ions by these homodimeric 'metal sensor' proteins. An evolutionary analysis, coupled with comparative structural and spectroscopic studies of six SmtB/ArsR family members, suggests a unifying 'theme and variations' model, in which individual members have evolved distinct metal selectivity profiles by alteration of one or both of two structurally distinct metal coordination sites. These two metal sites are designated $\alpha$3N (or $\alpha$3) and $\alpha$5 (or $\alpha$5C), named for the location of the metal binding ligands within the known or predicted secondary structure of individual family members. The $\alpha$3N/$\alpha$3 sensors, represented by Staphylococcus aureus pI258 CadC, Listeria monocytogenes CadC and Escherichia coli ArsR, form cysteine thiolate-rich coordination complexes (S3 or S4) with thiophilic heavy metal pollutants including Cd(II), Pb(II), Bi(III) and As(III) via inter-subunit coordination by ligands derived from the $\alpha$3 helix and the N-terminal 'arm' (CadCs) or from the $\alpha$3 helix only (ArsRs). The $\alpha$5/$\alpha$5C sensors Synechococcus SmtB, Synechocystis ZiaR, S. aureus CzrA, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis NmtR form metal complexes with biologically required metal ions Zn(II), Co(II) and Ni(II) characterized by four or more coordination bonds to a mixture of histidine and carboxylate ligands derived from the C-terminal $\alpha$5 helices on opposite subunits. Direct binding of metal ions to either the $\alpha$3N or $\alpha$5 sites leads to strong, negative allosteric regulation of repressor operator/promoter binding affinity, consistent with a simple model for derepression. We hypothesize that distinct allosteric pathways for metal sensing have co-evolved with metal specificities of distinct $\alpha$3N and $\alpha$5 coordination complexes. {\textcopyright} 2003 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

Due to their abundance in maize (Zea mays) and other important cereal crops, benzoxazinoids have been the subject of extensive research for {\textgreater}50 years. Whereas benzoxazinoids can account for 1{\%} or more of the dry weight in young seedlings constitutively, their accumulation in older plants is induced locally by pest and pathogen attack. Although the biosynthetic pathways for most maize benzoxazinoids have been identified, unanswered questions remain about the developmental and defense-induced regulation of benzoxazinoid metabolism. Recent research shows that, in addition to their central role in the maize chemical defense repertoire, benzoxazinoids may have important functions in regulating other defense responses, flowering time, auxin metabolism, iron uptake and perhaps aluminum tolerance. Investigation of natural variation in maize benzoxazinoid accumulation, which is greatly facilitated by recent genomics advances, will have a major impact in this research area by leading to the discovery of previously unknown genes and functions of benzoxazinoid metabolism.},

Of the antimicrobial agent tests, clarithromycin and amoxycillin had the lowest MIC50, 0.063 and 0.125 mg/L respectively, for 24 strains of H. pylori. Minocycline, levofloxacin and lansoprazole followed, with MIC50s of 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/L, respectively. Three-hour time-killing studies using a standard strain demonstrated a different pattern. At 4 x MIC, kanamycin, metronidazole and clarithromycin produced 4.4, 2.6 and 2.1 log decreases in viability, whereas the remaining seven antibiotics (including amoxycillin) were less bactericicdal. Amoxycillin's lack of bactericidal activity during brief incubations was confirmed by examining several different clinically isolated H. pylori strains. Clarithromycin's effect, on the other hand, was strain- and concentration-dependent. Kanamycin was the most potent antibiotic in short time-killing studies, with concentrations of 1 x MIC and 4 x MIC producing a reduction of more than 2 and 4 log respectively in all ten strains. Our data suggest that the MIC of antimicrobial agents against H. pylori does not necessarily predict their activity in short time-killing studies. Furthermore, our short time-kill data suggest kanamycin as a potential therapeutic choice for H. pylori infection, even though this agent's MIC would suggest limited activity.},

abstract = {Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is a major risk factor for gastric cancer (GC) development, which is one of the most challenging malignant diseases worldwide with limited treatments. In the multistep pathogenesis of GC, H. pylori infection slowly induces chronic active gastritis, which progresses through the premalignant stages of atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and dysplasia, and then finally to GC. Although eradication of H. pylori is a reasonable approach for the prevention of GC, there have been some contradictory reports, with only some long-term follow-up data showing efficacy of this approach. The inconsistencies are likely due to the insufficient number of participants, relatively short follow-up periods, poor quality of study designs, and the degree and extent of preneoplastic changes at the time of H. pylori eradication. This review analyzes recent high-quality studies to resolve the discrepancies regarding the eradication of H. pylori for GC prevention. The relationship between H. pylori eradication and GC/ precancerous lesions/metachronous GC is examined, and the cost-effectiveness of this strategy in the prevention of GC is assessed. Although it is assumed that eradication of H. pylori has the potential to prevent GC, the feasibility and appropriate timing of this strategy for cancer prevention remain to be determined. As a result, additional well-designed trials with longer followup periods are needed to clarify this issue. {\textcopyright} 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All rights reserved.},
