abstract = {Riboflavin, or more commonly known as vitamin B2, forms part of the component of vitamin B complex. Riboflavin consisting of two important cofactors, flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which are involved in multiple oxidative-reduction processes and energy metabolism. Besides maintaining human health, different sources reported that riboflavin can inhibit or inactivate the growth of different pathogens including bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites, highlighting the possible role of riboflavin as an antimicrobial agent. Moreover, riboflavin and flavins could produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) when exposed to light, inducing oxidative damage in cells and tissues, and thus are excellent natural photosensitizers. Several studies have illustrated the therapeutic efficacy of photoactivated riboflavin against nosocomial infections and multidrug resistant bacterial infections as well as microbial associated biofilm infections, revealing the potential role of riboflavin as a promising antimicrobial candidate, which could serve as one of the alternatives in fighting the global crisis of the emergence of antimicrobial resistance seen in different pathogenic microbes. Riboflavin could also be involved in modulating host immune responses, which might increase the pathogen clearance from host cells and increase host defense against microbial infections. Thus, the dual effects of riboflavin on both pathogens and host immunity, reflected by its potent bactericidal effect and alleviation of inflammation in host cells further imply that riboflavin could be a potential candidate for therapeutic intervention in resolving microbial infections. Hence, this review aimed to provide some insights on the promising role of riboflavin as an antimicrobial candidate and also a host immune-modulator from a multi-perspective view as well as to discuss the application and challenges on using riboflavin in photodynamic therapy against various pathogens and microbial biofilm-associated infections.},

abstract = {Phytophthora infestans, one of most famous pathogenic oomycetes, triggered the Great Irish Famine from 1845 to 1852. The target of rapamycin (TOR) is well known as a key gene in eukaryotes that controls cell growth, survival and development. However, it is unclear about its function in controlling the mycelial growth, sporulation capacity, spore germination and virulence of Phytophthora infestans. In this study, key components of the TOR signaling pathway are analyzed in detail. TOR inhibitors, including rapamycin (RAP), AZD8055 (AZD), KU-0063794 (KU), and Torin1, inhibit the mycelial growth, sporulation capacity, spore germination, and virulence of Phytophthora infestans with AZD showing the best inhibitory effects on Phytophthora infestans. Importantly, compared with a combination of RAP + KU or RAP + Torin1, the co-application of RAP and AZD show the best synergistic inhibitory effects on P. infestans, resulting in the reduced dosage and increased efficacy of drugs. Transcriptome analysis supports the synergistic effects of the combination of RAP and AZD on gene expression, functions and pathways related to the TOR signaling pathway. Thus, TOR is an important target for controlling Phytophthora infestans, and synergism based on the application of TOR inhibitors exhibit the potential for controlling the growth of Phytophthora infestans.},

abstract = {Depolymerization of polysaccharides is catalyzed by highly specific enzymes that promote hydrolysis of the scissile glycosidic bond by an activated water molecule. 1,3-1,4-$\beta$-Glucanases selectively cleave $\beta$-1,4 glycosidic bonds in 3-O-substituted glucopyranosyl units within polysaccharides with mixed linkage. The reaction follows a double-displacement mechanism by which the configuration of the anomeric C1-atom of the glucosyl unit in subsite −I is retained. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of the hybrid 1,3-1,4-$\beta$-glucanase H(A16-M)E105Q/E109Q in complex with a $\beta$-glucan tetrasaccharide. The structure shows four $\beta$-d-glucosyl moieties bound to the substrate-binding cleft covering subsites −IV to −I, thus corresponding to the reaction product. The ten active-site residues Asn26, Glu63, Arg65, Phe92, Tyr94, Glu105, Asp107, Glu109, Asn182 and Trp184 form a network of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic stacking interactions with the substrate. These residues were previously identified by mutational analysis as significant for stabilization of the enzyme–carbohydrate complex, with Glu105 and Glu109 being the catalytic residues. Compared to the Michaelis complex model, the tetrasaccharide moiety is slightly shifted toward that part of the cleft binding the non-reducing end of the substrate, but shows previously unanticipated strong stacking interactions with Phe92 in subsite −I. A number of specific hydrogen-bond contacts between the enzyme and the equatorial O2, O3 and O6 hydroxyl groups of the glucosyl residues in subsites −I, −II and −III are the structural basis for the observed substrate specificity of 1,3-1,4-$\beta$-glucanases. Kinetic analysis of enzyme variants with the all $\beta$-1,3 linked polysaccharide laminarin identified key residues mediating substrate specificity in good agreement with the structural data. The comparison with structures of the apo-enzyme H(A16-M) and a covalent enzyme–inhibitor (E{\textperiodcentered}I) complex, together with kinetic and mutagenesis data, yields new insights into the structural requirements for substrate binding and catalysis. A detailed view of enzyme–carbohydrate interactions is presented and mechanistic implications are discussed.},

abstract = {PURPOSE. To demonstrate the antimicrobial properties of riboflavin/ UV-A (365 nm) against fungal pathogens. METHODS. The antimicrobial properties of riboflavin/UV-A (365 nm), with or without previous treatment with amphotericin B, were tested on three groups of fungi selected from severe cases of keratomycosis: Candida albicans, Fusarium sp, and Aspergillus fumigatus. They were tested by using Kirby-Bauer discs with empty disc (control), riboflavin 0.1{\%} alone (R), UV-A alone (UV-A), riboflavin 0.1{\%} and additional UV-A exposure (R+UV-A), amphotericin B alone (A), amphotericin B and riboflavin 0.1{\%} (A+R), amphotericin B and UV-A (A+UV-A), amphotericin B and riboflavin 0.1{\%}, and additional UV-A exposure (A+R+UV-A). The mean growth inhibition zone (GIZ) was measured around the discs. RESULTS. C. albicans, Fusarium sp, and A. fumigatus did not show any increased GIZ after treatment without previous amphotericin B medication. However, GIZ was significantly greater after pretreatment with amphotericin B and riboflavin/ UV-A (A+R+UV-A) for C. albicans (P =0.0005), Fusarium sp (P =0.0023) and A. fumigatus (P =0.0008) compared with A, A+R, and A+UV-A. CONCLUSIONS. Amphotericin B is believed to interact with fungi membrane sterols to produce aggregates that form transmembrane channels. Given that collagen is one of the principal components of the cornea, it is also probable that amphotericin B may diffuse easily after cross-linking. Previous treatment with amphotericin B allowed riboflavin/UV-A effectiveness against C. albicans, Fusarium sp, and A. fumigatus. This schema might be used in the future for the treatment of keratomycosis. {\textcopyright} Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology.},

abstract = {As genomes evolve, they undergo large-scale evolutionary processes that present a challenge to sequence comparison not posed by short sequences. Recombination causes frequent genome rearrangements, horizontal transfer introduces new sequences into bacterial chromosomes, and deletions remove segments of the genome. Consequently, each genome is a mosaic of unique lineage-specific segments, regions shared with a subset of other genomes and segments conserved among all the genomes under consideration. Furthermore, the linear order of these segments may be shuffled among genomes. We present methods for identification and alignment of conserved genomic DNA in the presence of rearrangements and horizontal transfer. Our methods have been implemented in a software package called Mauve. Mauve has been applied to align nine enterobacterial genomes and to determine global rearrangement structure in three mammalian genomes. We have evaluated the quality of Mauve alignments and drawn comparison to other methods through extensive simulations of genome evolution. [Supplemental},

abstract = {Salecan, a linear extracellular polysaccharide consisting of $\beta$-1,3-D-glucan, has potential applications in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of salecan on soil microbial communities in a vegetable patch. Compositional shifts in the genetic structure of indigenous soil bacterial and fungal communities were monitored using culture-dependent dilution plating, culture-independent PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and quantitative PCR. After 60 days, soil microorganism counts showed no significant variation in bacterial density and a marked decrease in the numbers of fungi. The DGGE profiles revealed that salecan changed the composition of the microbial community in soil by increasing the amount of Bacillus strains and decreasing the amount of Fusarium strains. Quantitative PCR confirmed that the populations of the soil-borne fungi Fusarium oxysporum and Trichoderma spp. were decreased approximately 6- and 2-fold, respectively, in soil containing salecan. This decrease in the amount of fungi can be explained by salecan inducing an increase in the activities of $\beta$-1,3-glucanase in the soil. These results suggest the promising application of salecan for biological control of pathogens of soil-borne fungi.},

Genome mining is routinely used to complement screening-based workflows to discover novel natural products. Since 2011, the "antibiotics and secondary metabolite analysis shell - antiSMASH"(https://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org/) has supported researchers in their microbial genome mining tasks, both as a free-to-use web server and as a standalone tool under an OSI-approved open-source license. It is currently the most widely used tool for detecting and characterising biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in bacteria and fungi. Here, we present the updated version 6 of antiSMASH. antiSMASH 6 increases the number of supported cluster types from 58 to 71, displays the modular structure of multi-modular BGCs, adds a new BGC comparison algorithm, allows for the integration of results from other prediction tools, and more effectively detects tailoring enzymes in RiPP clusters.},
