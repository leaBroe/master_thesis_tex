abstract = {Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with a poorly defined genetic landscape, which poses a major challenge in diagnosis and treatment. By massively parallel mRNA sequencing, we obtained 1.2 billion reads from 17 individual human tissues belonging to TNBC, Non-TNBC, and HER2-positive breast cancers and defined their comprehensive digital transcriptome for the first time. Surprisingly, we identified a high number of novel and unannotated transcripts, revealing the global breast cancer transcriptomic adaptations. Comparative transcriptomic analyses elucidated differentially expressed transcripts between the three breast cancer groups, identifying several new modulators of breast cancer. Our study also identified common transcriptional regulatory elements, such as highly abundant primary transcripts, including osteonectin, RACK1, calnexin, calreticulin, FTL, and B2M, and "genomic hotspots" enriched in primary transcripts between the three groups. Thus, our study opens previously unexplored niches that could enable a better understanding of the disease and the development of potential intervention strategies.},

@article{multimapped,
abstract = {Many eukaryotic genomes harbour large numbers of duplicated sequences, of diverse biotypes, resulting from several mechanisms including recombination, whole genome duplication and retro-transposition. Such repeated sequences complicate gene/transcript quantification during RNA-seq analysis due to reads mapping to more than one locus, sometimes involving genes embedded in other genes. Genes of different biotypes have dissimilar levels of sequence duplication, with long-noncoding RNAs and messenger RNAs sharing less sequence similarity to other genes than biotypes encoding shorter RNAs. Many strategies have been elaborated to handle these multi-mapped reads, resulting in increased accuracy in gene/transcript quantification, although separate tools are typically used to estimate the abundance of short and long genes due to their dissimilar characteristics. This review discusses the mechanisms leading to sequence duplication, the biotypes affected, the computational strategies employed to deal with multi-mapped reads and the challenges that still remain to be overcome.},

@article{TFF1,
abstract = {Although trefoil factor 1 (TFF1; previously named pS2) is abnormally expressed in about 50{\%} of human breast tumors, its physiopathological role in this disease has been poorly studied. Moreover, controversial data have been reported. TFF1 function in the mammary gland therefore needs to be clarified. In this study, using retroviral vectors, we performed TFF1 gain- or loss-of-function experiments in four human mammary epithelial cell lines: normal immortalized TFF1-negative MCF10A, malignant TFF1-negative MDA-MB-231 and malignant TFF1-positive MCF7 and ZR75.1. The expression of TFF1 stimulated the migration and invasion in the four cell lines. Forced TFF1 expression in MCF10A, MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells did not modify anchorage-dependent or -independent cell proliferation. By contrast, TFF1 knockdown in MCF7 enhanced soft-agar colony formation. This increased oncogenic potential of MCF7 cells in the absence of TFF1 was confirmed in vivo in nude mice. Moreover, chemically induced tumorigenesis in TFF1-deficient (TFF1-KO) mice led to higher tumor incidence in the mammary gland and larger tumor size compared with wild-type mice. Similarly, tumor development was increased in the TFF1-KO ovary and lung. Collectively, our results clearly show that TFF1 does not exhibit oncogenic properties, but rather reduces tumor development. This beneficial function of TFF1 is in agreement with many clinical studies reporting a better outcome for patients with TFF1-positive breast primary tumors.},

abstract = {The human reference genome represents only a small number of individuals, which limits its usefulness for genotyping. We present a method named HISAT2 (hierarchical indexing for spliced alignment of transcripts 2) that can align both DNA and RNA sequences using a graph Ferragina Manzini index. We use HISAT2 to represent and search an expanded model of the human reference genome in which over 14.5 million genomic variants in combination with haplotypes are incorporated into the data structure used for searching and alignment. We benchmark HISAT2 using simulated and real datasets to demonstrate that our strategy of representing a population of genomes, together with a fast, memory-efficient search algorithm, provides more detailed and accurate variant analyses than other methods. We apply HISAT2 for HLA typing and DNA fingerprinting; both applications form part of the HISAT-genotype software that enables analysis of haplotype-resolved genes or genomic regions. HISAT-genotype outperforms other computational methods and matches or exceeds the performance of laboratory-based assays.},

abstract = {Overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in breast cancer patients is associated with increased incidence of breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM), but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. Here, to identify brain-predominant genes critical for the establishment of BCBM, we conducted an in silico screening analysis and identified that increased levels of fatty acid-binding protein 7 (FABP7) correlate with a lower survival and higher incidence of brain metastases in breast cancer patients. We validated these findings using HER2+ BCBM cells compared with parental breast cancer cells. Importantly, through knockdown and overexpression assays, we characterized the role of FABP7 in the BCBM process in vitro and in vivo. Our results uncover a key role of FABP7 in metabolic reprogramming of HER2 + breast cancer cells, supporting a glycolytic phenotype and storage of lipid droplets that enable their adaptation and survival in the brain microenvironment. In addition, FABP7 is shown to be required for upregulation of key metastatic genes and pathways, such as integrins-Src and VEGFA, and for the growth of HER2+ breast cancer cells in the brain microenvironment in vivo. Together, our results support FABP7 as a potential target for the treatment of HER2+ BCBM.},

abstract = {The pioneering function of FOXA1 establishes estrogen-responsive transcriptomes in luminal breast cancer. Dysregulated FOXA1 chromatin occupancy through focal amplification, muta-tion, or cofactor recruitment modulates estrogen receptor (ER) transcriptional programs and drives endocrine-resistant disease. However, ER is not the sole nuclear receptor (NR) expressed in breast cancers, nor is it the only NR for which FOXA1 serves as a licensing factor. Receptors for androgens, glucocorticoids, and progesterone are also found in the majority of breast cancers, and their functions are also impacted by FOXA1. These NRs interface with ER transcriptional programs and, depending on their activation level, can reprogram FOXA1-ER cistromes. Thus, NR interplay contributes to endocrine therapy response and resistance and may provide a vulnerability for future therapeutic benefit in patients. Herein, we review what is known regarding FOXA1 regulation of NR function in breast cancer in the context of cell identity, endocrine resistance, and NR crosstalk in breast cancer progression and treatment.},

Methods: A microarray data set comprised of 513 diverse normal and tumor mRNA samples was analyzed to identify breast tumor biomarkers with minimal expression in normal tissues. Results:FSIP1 was identified as a breast tumor biomarker with elevated mRNA expression in breast tumors and minimal expression in most normal tissues except the testis. Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed the elevated expression of FSIP1 mRNA in breast tumors and revealed a significant correlation with ER-positive status. Immunofluorescence staining of breast tumor sections showed that the majority of breast tumors examined in this study (20 out of 22) expressed detectable FSIP1 protein, with significantly higher than average expression in ER-positive versus ER-negative breast tumors. Conclusion: The prevalence and uniformity of FSIP1 expression in breast tumors, taken together with the highly restricted expression in normal tissues, suggests that FSIP1 may be an attractive target for breast cancer immunotherapy. {\textcopyright} 2013 Future Medicine Ltd.},

There will be an estimated 18.1 million new cancer cases (17.0 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and 9.6 million cancer deaths (9.5 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) in 2018. In both sexes combined, lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (11.6{\%} of the total cases) and the leading cause of cancer death (18.4{\%} of the total cancer deaths), closely followed by female breast cancer (11.6{\%}), prostate cancer (7.1{\%}), and colorectal cancer (6.1{\%}) for incidence and colorectal cancer (9.2{\%}), stomach cancer (8.2{\%}), and liver cancer (8.2{\%}) for mortality. Lung cancer is the most frequent cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among males, followed by prostate and colorectal cancer (for incidence) and liver and stomach cancer (for mortality). Among females, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, followed by colorectal and lung cancer (for incidence), and vice versa (for mortality); cervical cancer ranks fourth for both incidence and mortality. The most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, however, substantially vary across countries and within each country depending on the degree of economic development and associated social and life style factors. It is noteworthy that high-quality cancer registry data, the basis for planning and implementing evidence-based cancer control programs, are not available in most low- and middle-income countries.

abstract = {Oncogenic gene fusions are estimated to account for up-to 20{\%} of cancer morbidity. Recently sequence-level studies have established oncofusions throughout all tissue types. However, the functional implications of the identified oncofusions have often not been investigated. In this study, identified oncofusions from a fusion detection approach (DEEPEST) were analyzed in detail. Of the 28,863 oncofusions, we found almost 30{\%} are expected to produce functional proteins with features from both parent genes. Kinases and transcription factors were the main gene families of the protein producing fusions. Considering their role as initiators, actors, and termination points of cellular signaling pathways, we focused our in-depth analyses on them. Domain architecture of the fusions and their wild-type interactors suggests that abnormal molecular context of protein domains caused by fusion events may unlock the oncogenic potential of the wild type counterparts of the fusion proteins. To understand overall oncofusion effects, we performed differential expression analysis using TCGA cancer project samples. Results indicated oncofusion-specific alterations in gene expression levels, and lower expression levels of components of key cellular pathways, in particular signal transduction and transcription regulation. The sum of results suggests that kinase and transcription factor oncofusions deregulate cellular signaling, possibly via acquiring novel functions.},

@article{CALML5,
abstract = {In the course of identifying the molecular mechanism that is related to strong cell-cell adhesion in stratified structures of the squamous epithelium, calmodulin-like protein 5 (CALML5) was identified as a spinous structure-associated protein by producing monoclonal antibodies with the use of the crude intercellular portion of squamous tissue as an immunogen and by subsequent morphologic screening. By electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and a series of mutagenesis studies, two transcription factors, ZNF750 and KLF4, by binding in line to the CALML5 gene promoter, were found to play a central role in CALML5 transcription. Knockdown of CALML5 by siRNA in the A431 cell line that expresses high levels of CALML5 resulted in the acceleration of wound confluence in a scratch assay, indicating that CALML5 functions as a tumor-suppressor in uterine cervical cancer. Immunohistochemical evaluation of squamous intraepithelial lesions, carcinoma in situ (CIS) and invasive uterine cancer, revealed a reduction in CALML5 expression during the stages of CIS through various molecular pathways including the blockage of the nuclear translocation of KLF4. Conversely, restoration of the nuclear translocation of KLF4 by inhibiting ERK-signaling reactivated CALML5 expression in ME180 cells expressing low levels of CALML5. Thus, alteration of the p63-ZNF750-KLF4 axis may result in critical functional loss of CALM-related genes during cancer progression. Although the morphological association of CALML5 with the spiny-structure in relation to cell motility is not clear, evaluation of CALML5 expression provides a useful diagnostic indicator of differentiating dysplasia, preinvasive and invasive cervical cancers.},

@article{FeatureCounts,
abstract = {Motivation: Next-generation sequencing technologies generate millions of short sequence reads, which are usually aligned to a reference genome. In many applications, the key information required for downstream analysis is the number of reads mapping to each genomic feature, for example to each exon or each gene. The process of counting reads is called read summarization. Read summarization is required for a great variety of genomic analyses but has so far received relatively little attention in the literature.Results: We present featureCounts, a read summarization program suitable for counting reads generated from either RNA or genomic DNA sequencing experiments. featureCounts implements highly efficient chromosome hashing and feature blocking techniques. It is considerably faster than existing methods (by an order of magnitude for gene-level summarization) and requires far less computer memory. It works with either single or paired-end reads and provides a wide range of options appropriate for different sequencing applications. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author 2013.

abstract = {Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are phase II enzymes that are involved in the detoxification of a wide range of carcinogens. The novel GSTA1*A and GSTA1*B genetic polymorphism results in differential expression, with lower transcriptional activation of GSTA1*B (variant) than that of GSTA1*A (common) allele. Considering that cruciferous vegetables induce GSTs, which metabolize tobacco smoke carcinogens, we hypothesized that the variant GSTA1*B genotype may predispose women to breast cancer, particularly among low cruciferous vegetable consumers and among smokers. Thus, we evaluated potential relationships between GSTA1 polymorphisms and breast cancer risk, in relation to vegetable consumption and smoking status in the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project (1996-1997), a population-based case-control study. Genotyping (1036 cases and 1089 controls) was performed, and putative breast cancer risk factors and usual dietary intakes were assessed. Having GSTA1*A/*B or *B/*B genotypes was not associated with increased breast cancer risk, compared to having the common *A/*A genotype. However, among women in the lowest two tertiles of cruciferous vegetable consumption, *B/*B genotypes were associated with increased risk (OR (95{\%} CI) = 1.73 (1.10-2.72) for 0-1 servings/week), compared to women with *A/*A genotypes. Among women with *B/*B genotypes, a significant inverse trend between cruciferous vegetable consumption and breast cancer risk was observed (P for trend = 0.05), and higher consumption (4+ servings/week) ameliorated the increased risk associated with the genotype. Current smokers with *B/*B genotypes had a 1.89-fold increase in risk (OR (95{\%} CI) = 1.89 (1.09-3.25)), compared with never smokers with *A/*A genotypes. These data indicate that GSTA1 genotypes related to reduced GSTA1 expression are associated with increased breast cancer primarily among women with lower consumption of cruciferous vegetables and among current smokers. {\textcopyright} 2006 Oxford University Press.},

@article{VGLL1,
abstract = {Vestigial-like 1 (VGLL1) is a poorly characterized gene encoding a transcriptional co-activator structurally homologous to TAZ and YAP that modulates the Hippo pathway in Drosophila. In this study, we examined the expression of VGLL1 and its intronic miRNA, miR-934, in breast cancer. VGLL1 and miR-934 expression miRNA profiling was carried out on frozen samples of grade 3 invasive ductal carcinomas. VGLL1 protein was also examined in 433 sporadic and BRCA1-associated breast carcinomas on tissue microarrays. RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was used to confirm differences in VGLL1 and miR-934 expression in different breast cancer subtypes, and to correlate their expression with that of other genes and miRNAs. Of 28 miRNAs differentially expressed in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and ER-negative grade 3 breast carcinomas, miR-934 was most strongly upregulated in ER-negative carcinomas, and its expression was correlated with that of VGLL1. Nuclear VGLL1 expression was observed in 13{\%} of sporadic breast carcinomas, and while VGLL1 was only occasionally found in luminal A (0.70{\%}) and B (5.60{\%}) carcinomas, it was often expressed in HER2-positive (17{\%}), triple-negative (TN) breast carcinomas ({\textgreater}40{\%}) and BRCA1-associated TN carcinomas ({\textgreater}50{\%}). These findings were confirmed in the TCGA dataset, which revealed positive associations with luminal progenitor genes (GABRP, SLC6A14, FOXC1, PROM1, and BBOX1 ) and strong negative correlations with ER-associated genes (ESR1, C6ORF211, GATA3, and FOXA1). Moreover, VGLL1 expression was associated with reduced overall survival. In conclusion, VGLL1 and miR-934 are mainly expressed in sporadic and BRCA1-associated TN basal-like breast carcinomas, and their coordinated expression, at least partially mediated by the direct modulation of ESR1, might be involved in the maintenance of a luminal progenitor phenotype. {\textcopyright} 2014 Society for Endocrinology.

@article{hormad1,
abstract = {Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) are characterized by a wide spectrum of genomic alterations, some of which might be caused by defects in DNA repair processes such as homologous recombination (HR). Despite this understanding, associating particular patterns of genomic instability with response to therapy has been challenging. Here, we show that allelic-imbalanced copy-number aberrations (AiCNA) are more prevalent in TNBCs that respond to platinum-based chemotherapy, thus providing a candidate predictive biomarker for this disease. Furthermore, we show that a high level of AiCNA is linked with elevated expression of a meiosis-associated gene, HORMAD1. Elevated HORMAD1 expression suppresses RAD51-dependent HR and drives the use of alternative forms of DNA repair, the generation of AiCNAs, as well as sensitizing cancer cells to HR-targeting therapies. Our data therefore provide a mechanistic association between HORMAD1 expression, a specific pattern of genomic instability, and an association with response to platinum-based chemotherapy in TNBC. SIGNIFICANCE: Previous studies have shown correlation between mutational "scars" and sensitivity to platinums extending beyond associations with BRCA1/2 mutation, but do not elucidate the mechanism. Here, a novel allele-specific copy-number characterization of genome instability identifies and functionally validates the inappropriate expression of the meiotic gene HORMAD1 as a driver of HR deficiency in TNBC, acting to induce allelic imbalance and moderate platinum and PARP inhibitor sensitivity with implications for the use of such "scars" and expression of meiotic genes as predictive biomarkers.},

Because TNBC tumors lack ER, PR, and HER2 expression, they are not sensitive to endocrine therapy or HER2 treatment, and standardized TNBC treatment regimens are still lacking. Therefore, development of new TNBC treatment strategies has become an urgent clinical need.

abstract = {Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women and the second leading cause of their cancer death. Establishing an accurate BC prognosis is very difficult because of its heterogeneity. Elevated TFF1 levels in serum were associated with development of BC, TFF1 expression was upregulated in BC compared to the healthy breast tissue. The aim of this study was to investigate the function of TFF1 in BCs, and to assess whether serum TFF1 could be used in formulating a prognosis for BC patients. In silico analyses were carried out to determine the expression of TFF1 mRNA in different types of BC and the association between TFF1 expression and survival of BC patients. Expression of TFF1 protein was checked in 52 paraffin-embedded tissues of BCs by immunochemistry, and serum concentration of TFF1 in 70 BC patients and 32 healthy controls was measured by ELISA. Functional activities of TFF1 in BC cells were determined by CCK-8 assay, colony formation, BrdU-DNA synthesis, and assays for migration and invasion. Results showed that expression of TFF1 mRNA was correlated with expression of biomarkers of luminal cancers including ESR1, GATA3, FOXA1, MYB and XBP1. In addition, patients with ER+BC had higher expression of TFF1 than those with ER- (p {\textless} 0.05). There was also lower expression of TFF1 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) than in non-TNBC (p {\textless} 0.05), which corresponds with the level of serum TFF1 in TNBC patients, compared with non-TNBC patients (p {\textless} 0.001). Furthermore, expression of TFF1 was associated with tumor size (p = 0.002), nodal status (p {\textless} 0.001), histological grade (p {\textless} 0.001), ER status (p = 0.012), PR status (p {\textless} 0.001) and HER2 (p {\textless} 0.001), while serum TFF1 was only statistically different among BC with ER+, PR + and HER2+ (p = 0.04139, 0.0018, 0.0004). Elevated TFF1 expression correlated with increased overall survival of BC patients (p = 0.00068). Finally, TFF1 was found to inhibit the cell growth, colony formation, migration and invasion of BC cells in vitro. All these results suggest that expression of TFF1 was related to ER status of BC and that expression of TFF1 was lower in TNBC than in non-TNBC. TFF1 was found to inhibit proliferation, migration and invasion of BC cells in vitro. Expression of TFF1 was associated with clinical characters of patients with BC. Serum TFF1 could be used to predict prognosis of patients with BC, especially non-TNBC.},

abstract = {Blood-based early detection of breast cancer has recently gained novel momentum, as liquid biopsy diagnostics is a fast emerging field. In this study, we aimed to identify secreted proteins which are up-regulated both in tumour tissue and serum samples of breast cancer patients compared to normal tissue and sera. Based on two independent tissue cohorts (n = 75 and n = 229) and one serum cohort (n = 80) of human breast cancer and healthy serum samples, we characterised AGR3 as a novel potential biomarker both for breast cancer prognosis and early breast cancer detection from blood. AGR3 expression in breast tumours is significantly associated with oestrogen receptor $\alpha$ (P{\textless}0.001) and lower tumour grade (P{\textless}0.01). Interestingly, AGR3 protein expression correlates with unfavourable outcome in low (G1) and intermediate (G2) grade breast tumours (multivariate hazard ratio: 2.186, 95{\%} CI: 1.008-4.740, P{\textless}0.05) indicating an independent prognostic impact. In sera analysed by ELISA technique, AGR3 protein concentration was significantly (P{\textless}0.001) elevated in samples from breast cancer patients (n = 40, mainly low stage tumours) compared to healthy controls (n = 40). To develop a suitable biomarker panel for early breast cancer detection, we measured AGR2 protein in human serum samples in parallel. The combined AGR3/AGR2 biomarker panel achieved a sensitivity of 64.5{\%} and a specificity of 89.5{\%}as shown by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve statistics. Thus our data clearly show the potential usability of AGR3 and AGR2 as biomarkers for blood-based early detection of human breast cancer.},

abstract = {Background: Phophoserine phosphatase-like (PSPHL) is expressed at significantly higher levels in breast tumors from African American women (AAW) compared to Caucasian women (CW). How overexpression of PSPHL contributes to outcome disparities is unclear, thus, molecular mechanisms driving expression differences between populations were evaluated.Results: PCR was used to detect deletion of 30-Kb of chromosome 7p11 including the first three exons of PSPHL using genomic DNA from AAW (199 with invasive breast cancer, 360 controls) and CW (invasive breast cancer =589, 364 controls). Gene expression levels were evaluated by qRT-PCR using RNA isolated from tumor tissue and blood. Data were analyzed using chi-square analysis and Mann-Whitney U-tests; P {\textless} 0.05 was used to define significance. Gene expression levels correlated with deletion status: patients homozygous for the deletion had no detectable expression of PSPHL, while heterozygous had expression levels 2.1-fold lower than those homozygous for retention of PSPHL. Homozygous deletion of PSPHL was detected in 61{\%} of CW compared to 6{\%} of AAW with invasive breast cancer (P {\textless} 0.0001); genotype frequencies did not differ significantly between AAW with and without breast cancer (P = 0.211).Conclusions: Thus, deletion of 7p11, which prevents expression of PSPHL, is significantly higher in CW compared to AAW, suggesting that this 30-kb deletion and subsequent disruption of PSPHL may be a derived trait in Caucasians. The similar frequency of the deletion allele in AAW with and without invasive breast cancer suggests that this difference represent population stratification, and does not contribute to cancer disparities. {\textcopyright} 2014 Rummel et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},
